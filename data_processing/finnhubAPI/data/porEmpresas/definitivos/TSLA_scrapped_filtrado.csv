The Physical Intelligence-led funding will expedite the development of the highest payload-to-weight ratio craft
NEW YORK & BENGALURU, India, October 14, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Airbound, an autonomous delivery logistics firm specializing in blended-wing-body aircraft, today announced $8.65 million in seed funding and a pilot partnership with Narayana Health. The round was led by Lachy Groom, co-founder of Physical Intelligence, with participation from Humba Ventures and continued participation from Lightspeed. This seed round also includes investment from senior leaders at Tesla, SpaceX, and Anduril, reflecting deep conviction from operators who have scaled complex hardware and autonomy programs.
Airbound's proprietary carbon fiber manufacturing process has enabled rapid production, with the company now producing crafts everyday. The one-of-a-kind craft features a blended-wing-body with a vertical lift tail-sitter design, achieving a payload-to-aircraft mass ratio of 1kg-to-1.5kg. The combination of the tailsitter configuration with a BWB enables vertical takeoff and landing while maintaining the aerodynamic efficiency of fixed-wing flight, avoiding the performance penalties that affect tilt-rotor and quadplane aircraft designs.
""We are grateful to our incoming and current investors for supporting our vision to make the cost of delivery negligible,"" said Naman Pushp, Founder and CEO of Airbound. ""The healthcare sector represents the perfect testing ground for our technology because it demands both reliability and efficiency. Our partnership with Narayana Health validates that our approach can handle the most critical delivery requirements while demonstrating the cost advantages that will make our service accessible globally.""
With this funding, Airbound aims to continue reducing delivery costs to the point where geographic distance becomes irrelevant for accessing goods and services. The company's mission is to provide access to essential items, regardless of location, with a particular initial emphasis on underserved regions where traditional logistics infrastructure is limited.
""Airbound's approach to drone delivery addresses fundamental physics and economics problems that have limited the scalability of existing solutions,"" said Lachy Groom, co-founder of Physical Intelligence. ""Their blended-wing-body design and manufacturing capabilities position them to achieve the cost efficiency needed to make drone delivery truly viable for a wide range of applications."""

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has been a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) supporter, labeling it as a “vital means of resistance” earlier.
Nobel Peace Prize Winner Is A Bitcoiner
Machado was honored for her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela"" and her ""struggle"" against the Nicolás Maduro regime by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.
Interestingly, Machado thanked President Donald Trump after receiving the award. Trump’s supporters were aggressively pushing for his Nobel Peace Prize victory leading up to the event.

Amid the flow of congratulatory messages, several Bitcoin-focused X accounts began circulating clips from a 2024 interview in which Machado is seen supporting the apex cryptocurrency.
BTC A ‘Lifeline’ For Venezuelans
Speaking with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation, Machado described Bitcoin as a “lifeline” for Venezuelans during periods of hyperinflation.
""Bitcoin bypasses government imposed exchange rates and thus helps many of our people"","" the opposition leader said. ""it has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance.""
Machado said that a ""new democratic Venezuela"" will embrace Bitcoin and that she sees the digital asset becoming part of the country's national reserves.
Venezuela ranked among the leading Latin American countries in cryptocurrency usage, recording nearly $45 billion in transaction volume during the period between July 2024 and June 2025, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.
The Venezuelan bolívar collapsed by almost 98% against the U.S. dollar in the last 10 years, potentially accelerating the shift toward assets that can safeguard savings.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.
SoFi Alt Investments
SoFi gives membersaccess to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.

- Markets roiled after Trump threatened an extra 100% tariff on Chinese goods, then said, ""Don't worry.""
- Elon Musk took a $16 billion blow, while Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg each took $10 billion hits.
The world's 10 richest people lost nearly $70 billion on Friday as fresh fears of a global trade war rattled markets.
The value of their stock holdings tumbled after President Donald Trump said the US would impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China from November 1, and restrict its access to ""any and all critical software,"" after China tightened export controls on rare earth elements and other key materials for advanced tech manufacturing.
Tesla stock slid 5% on Friday, shrinking CEO Elon Musk's wealth by about $16 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw around $10 billion erased from their respective net worths as the e-commerce giant's stock fell 5% and the social media titan's shares dropped almost 4%.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took an $8 billion hit as the chipmaker's stock fell nearly 5%, while Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and Dell CEO Michael Dell both saw their fortunes shrink by more than $5 billion as shares of their companies retreated on worries of slower growth and more trade disruption. In all, the world's 10 wealthiest people saw a $69 billion wealth reduction.
Trump sought to reassure markets, posting to Truth Social on Sunday, ""Don't worry, It will all be fine."" Shares of Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Dell were trading around 2% higher as of 10:20 a.m ET on Monday, while Oracle shares were up 4.5%.
The 10 richest people's wealth loss sounds painful, but they were still collectively worth over $2.9 trillion at Friday's close, led by Musk's $437 billion, Ellison's $351 billion, Zuckerberg's $248 billion, and Bezos' $240 billion.
They were still $385 billion in the green for this year as of Friday, with a $159 billion year-to-date wealth gain for Ellison alone, fueled by Oracle's 75% stock surge in 2025.
All of them except LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault rank among the largest shareholders of US tech giants, meaning they've benefited significantly from the buzz around AI that has boosted tech stocks this year."

Cybertruck sales plunged as the rest of the EV market surged, suggesting Tesla’s flashiest project is becoming its weakest link
Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images
The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s flex: a stainless-steel symbol of Elon Musk’s unflinching futurism. But instead, the pickup’s luster is continuing to wear thin.
Suggested Reading
According to Cox Automotive’s latest EV sales report, Tesla sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks in the third quarter, down 62.6% from a year earlier. The decline came as the broader U.S. EV market posted its strongest quarter on record, with sales up nearly 30% to more than 438,000 vehicles. Ford sold almost twice as many electric F-150 Lightning trucks in the same quarter, while even Chevrolet’s fledgling Silverado EV and Rivian’s R1T gained ground.
Related Content
The Cybertruck comparison is slightly distorted by timing — Q3 2024 captured the truck’s early ramp — but even adjusting for that, deliveries have slowed, and orders have thinned. And the sales drop came even as buyers rushed to lock in federal EV tax credits before they expired in late September, a policy boost that's now in the rearview mirror.
Tesla still commands about 41% of the EV market, but its share has slipped from nearly half last year — and the company’s stainless-steel pickup is the biggest drag on its lead. The company’s core models still move volume, but its more ambitious projects — from the Cybertruck to the long-promised robotaxi — are proving harder to scale than to hype.
When Musk unveiled the Cybertruck back in 2019, its $39,990 price tag, Blade Runner aesthetic, and millions of preorders looked like a dare to Detroit. But nearly six years later, the sticker shock has flipped. The cheapest version now starts above $60,000, and early adopters are discovering that the attention-grabbing angles don’t make for a particularly practical ride.
The Model Y remains the country’s best-selling EV by far, yet Tesla’s total share has fallen eight points in a year as rivals finally scale up. What was once a moat of innovation is now crowded with well-funded competition, and the Cybertruck’s sharp edges (and fit and finish issues) are beginning to look like a distraction.
The Cybertruck was meant to signal Tesla’s next era — a company moving beyond sedans and SUVs into America’s most profitable vehicle class. Instead, the model is revealing Tesla’s limits. Demand elsewhere may remain robust, but the truck is exposing how hard it is to act like a disruptor once you’ve become the incumbent."

Bitcoin’s (CRYPTO: BTC) flash crash late Friday, which happened outside of regular trading hours, has reignited debate about the operating hours of spot BTC exchange-traded funds, particularly the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ:IBIT).
BTC’s Deadly Weekend Crash
The apex cryptocurrency collapsed from $116,000 to under $110,000 within minutes after President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on China in response to “aggressive stance” on export controls.
The sudden spike caught traders off-guard, triggering over $19 billion in liquidations, the largest single-day wipeout in cryptocurrency history.”
Trending: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.81 a Share
ETF Investors Left In The Lurch?
The crash fueled concerns about the lack of 24/7 trading of BTC exchange-traded funds, which have become a popular vehicle for institutional investors, Forbes reported, quoting Tommy Doyle, global head of client management at Xapo Bank.
""The extreme volatility in the price of Bitcoin overnight highlights why institutional investors increasingly view access to 24/7 liquidity as essential to prudent risk management,” Doyle said.
Notably, these ETFs, including the nearly $100 billion IBIT, are bound by stock trading hours, which prevents investors from responding to weekend price shifts.
“Whilst Bitcoin ETFs remain bound by traditional market trading hours, institutional investors with direct bitcoin accounts can continue to access liquidity and risk manage their bitcoin exposure throughout the weekend, especially relevant amid recent seismic price moves,” Doyle told Forbes.

Emily Flippen: The landscape of commerce is turning increasingly social. EV demand has been dampening, and are tariffs actually working? We'll discuss today on Motley Fool Money.
I'm Emily Flippen. Today, I'm joined by analysts Jason Hall and Dan Caplinger to discuss how the sale of TikTok in the United States could change the way we shop here at the start of Prime Day, as well as expectations for demand for electric vehicles now that domestic EV tax credits have expired. But first, I think it's worth taking a deeper look at whether or not we can call tariffs a success. I suspect all of our listeners are already familiar with the tariffs that the Trump administration has sought to implement over the course of the past year. Most empirical evidence says that, generally speaking, tariffs don't spur economic growth. In fact, most economists and investors speculated that they would actually cause profits to drop, stocks to fall, consumer spending to ease, and inflation to rise. But so far, it doesn't really seem like that's been the case. In fact, it's really been the opposite. Stocks are up. The economy has been really resilient, and inflation does seem to be moderating. Jason, when you look at this picture in terms of the economic policies we're seeing here, is it too early to call tariffs a relative success?
Jason Hall: I think if you're talking about the administration's goal of boosting US manufacturing, it's definitely way too early. So far, the only industries that have really been helped are the ones where there's already an entrenched base. You think about metals production, steel manufacturing. They've basically gotten a free license to increase their prices based on the tariffs that are in place on imports in those industries. You look at other manufacturing industries like the auto industry, whole building construction is a massive buyer of manufactured goods. They've actually been net hurt because they rely on a lot of imported goods, and the US just can't flip the switch quickly to produce those goods domestically. The agricultural sector has been impacted. We've seen countries like China has pulled back on buying US soybeans because of reciprocal tariffs, and tariffs on Chinese goods that are imported into the US. Semiconductor companies are feeling a huge pinch in China. Chinese companies are basically being told don't buy US chips unless you have no other choice. You look at the stock market, guys, this is an AI story. A JP Morgan analyst put out a research note, and he pointed out that since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022, three quarters of the S&P 500 returns have come from AI-related companies. Over that same period, 80% of the S&P 500's earnings growth has come from those companies. If you start peeling back the layers, it's obvious that we have a bifurcated market and economy. Plenty of companies are not doing well. In a lot of cases, because tariffs are either increasing their costs and/or putting pressure on already squeezed consumers who have been feeling the pinch from inflation for four years now.
Emily Flippen: I think it's a fair point that there's clearly this disconnect that's happening between what consumers are feeling and what the stock market is doing and what investors are experiencing. But if the stock market isn't actually the correct indicator of how well the economy is doing it, that's not the barometer we're looking at. If that's not the scoreboard, Dan, when you look at it, what is the right gauge for gauging or judging success?
Dan Caplinger: Well, I think there's a couple of directions that you can go with that, Emily. The first is to judge it from the goals that the administration had. I think that one of the primary goals that the Trump administration had was to make companies, both foreign and domestic, have the internal conversation. Are we interested in expanding US manufacturing capacity? Are we interested in sourcing more products that go to US consumers from US sources? That's the goal. I think those conversations are happening that they have taken place. As Jason said, the answer is not always going to be necessarily what the administration wanted, but they've definitely been able to define the conversation. They've been able to set the subject and put that in front of people, and let those folks come to whatever conclusions they have for their businesses. I think for big businesses, like Jason said, it's not always going to be a matter of flipping the switch, but it is a matter of if they make the decision to move more production and sourcing to US, that's going to be an option for them. It's the small businesses that I think have more trouble. Emily, I live in the middle of nowhere in Western Massachusetts. No big cities near me. There are plenty of small businesses that really did rely on cheaper goods from other countries in order to keep afloat. These tariffs, they are the marginal companies. They are the companies that are having to go out of business because of the extra costs due to the tariffs. They don't have the margins to be able to absorb those tariffs temporarily. That's the distinction that I see. The other thing that I think is a real issue is not so much the tariffs themselves, but the uncertainty surrounding how long are tariffs going to be in place? Are they going to be permanent? Is the rate going to change? Is it going to go up? Is it going to go down? It's impossible for businesses to have a good long-term sense of, OK, if an investment is going to take 5-10 years to pay off, is the policy just going to change back? Or is it going to get worse? Or am I making a smart decision? It's just really difficult to figure that out.
Jason Hall: That's exactly right, Dan. It takes years to transition manufacturing and supply chains. We're six months into this, guys. The bigger question that I think we don't know the answer to is will US buyers, whether it's consumers or businesses, are they going to be willing to soak up the higher cost to manufacture more things domestically? According to an American Enterprise Institute study, there's about $1.7 trillion in goods that the administration is targeting to try to bring to domestic manufacturing, and it would cost about 21% more to manufacture them at home. That's an extra $257 billion a year. Plus, there's another $348 billion in tariffs that the AEI estimates would have to remain in place to keep that US manufacturing competitive. That's $606 billion a year that American buyers would have to pay for the same goods we're buying today. I mentioned AI before. Maybe this is the problem that AI can help solve.
Dan Caplinger: Being a little glib.
Jason Hall: But maybe that actually is part of the answer.
Emily Flippen: Dare to dream here. I have to say, I think that part of the impact and part of the reason why there is that disconnect is just because we haven't felt the full force of the economic brunt of these tariffs. I saw some interesting data that was collected by Bloomberg over the course of the past month. They tracked more than two dozen of Temu. That is the shopping site owned by Pinduoduo, PDD Holdings, their most popular products. They found that their prices actually fell nearly 20% between April and September because they were attempting to make up for some of the costs that consumers were going to be paying for these tariffs. Further data collected by Goldman Sachs has shown that even American businesses have taken on the majority of the brunt of the cost of tariff impacts, that shoe will have to drop eventually, which is to say they can't continue to take on the impacts of tariffs to your point. Dan, we don't know exactly how long they're going to continue, what they could look like over the long term. Right now, consumers aren't bearing the full impact. I expect that, especially as we go into the holiday season, if we start to see some of those price increases come down the line, and businesses, whether they be domestic or foreign start to pass along those price increases, that's when we'll really start to see the economic impacts, and that's when we'll start to have it show up in our economic data as well. Up next, we'll be moving to the other side of the purchase equation to discuss TikTok, Prime Day, and how social commerce has redefined the shopping experience. Stick with us.
Today is the first day of Prime Day, and we're all underwhelmed. It seems like despite posting record dollars every year, a results that I have no doubt is driven by mainly inflation, enthusiasm from shoppers just always feel increasingly diffused year after year. Dan, when you look at Prime Day and social commerce in general, is this just a combination of weaker economic conditions or just shoppers changing the way that they're shopping or is it just something else entirely?
Dan Caplinger: I'm embarrassed to say that when we first talked about this topic, I was like, ""Whoa, it's going to be Prime Day again? Wasn't it just Prime Day like a few months ago?"" That's the thing is that we've been having Prime Day. Consumers like fresh concepts, fresh ideas. Prime Day is maybe hitting it past its prime, perhaps. It's been going on for 10 years now. It's a long time to keep it new, keep it interesting, keep it front and center. Amazon's done what they can to try to build and iterate and make it more interesting, but it's faced a bunch of problems. One is that the rest of retail said, ""Okay. Fine, Amazon, you want to create this new holiday for shopping in the middle of the year? Well, we'll be happy to sell to our customers at the same time on the same days as well."" It's not just Amazon having this random sale in the middle of the year. It's everybody else now jumping onto that and saying, ""Hey, people are in the mood to buy. Why don't you buy from us instead of them?"" Amazon hasn't really been able to maintain exclusive ownership of the event. The other thing I think is, keep in mind, Amazon, the original goal of Prime Day, probably first and foremost, was to try to get people to sign up for Amazon Prime, for the subscription service. Back in 2015, there were a lot of people who weren't Prime members. But 10 years later, there are a lot of Prime members. It's almost mission accomplished. There's just not that many people left to sign up. As a result, I think Amazon is facing this existential question with Prime Day. It's like, what do we want it this to be going forward? We've already done a great job of increasing our market share of the number of shoppers in the US and elsewhere who are Prime members. At the same time, plenty of other reasons to join Prime outside to shopping. It may be time for a reset, I think.
Jason Hall: Dan, I think it's more an indictment of you and me in our demographic, because you're not the only GenX dude on this podcast that did not realize that Prime Day was starting. Guys, I spend an embarrassingly large amount of money on Amazon every single week. That's the bottom line. But here's the thing. Literally, guys, as I'm typing out the outline, I get a text from my wife, and I'm going to read it to you guys now. I quote, ""I've got a slap full Amazon cart for Prime Day. I want to chat about it with you."" I don't really know if there's really anything else to say. We're not really the target anymore for that, but here's the other thing that I think maybe matters more. The noise around social shopping is pretty loud right now, but if there's anything we've learned from social media is that it's a great marketing channel, but literally nowhere across social media, his shopping is a habitual thing stuck. Facebook has tried it. Twitter has tried marketing. We've seen Pinterest make fits and starts attempts, and there's not a better social platform than Pinterest to be e-commerce. I think it may be a thing that maybe drives fashion trends and that thing, but it's more a top of the funnel. I think shopping is just a habitual thing. If you look at the numbers, again, we know that the lower and middle income consumers are the ones being squeezed. We can look at McDonald's and Amazon competitor Walmart as just some data points I think support it. McDonald's comps were 2.5% last quarter at the same source sales growth. That's lower than inflation. Walmart's revenue was up 5% in the second quarter. It's e-commerce sales are up 25%. That shows you there's still a lot of pressure. Then thinking about those inflation and tariff that we talked about before, GAAP operating income was actually down 8% and flat on an adjusted basis. I don't think we're going to see some massive disruption of retail from what's going on with TikTok potentially becoming US company or any of those sorts of things. It's just a tough time for consumers right now, and these big companies are feeling that pinch.
Emily Flippen: I actually disagree, Jason.
Jason Hall: I love the fact that you disagree.
Emily Flippen: I think you're right. Conceptually, big picture, you're right. But I do think when you look at social commerce in general, especially the way it operates in international geographies versus here in the United States, it just shows how people tend to engage with what they were raised on or habitualized. There's so many Prime shoppers, for instance, that were habitualized with buying on Amazon. To your point, Dan, it's no longer really about getting people to sign up for Prime. It's just a reminder you're mostly doing all your shopping on Amazon anyway, so it's just an excuse to maybe buy one or two extra things that went on sale today or maybe you delayed purchasing until they were on sale. When I look at the way that social commerce and e-commerce was built in places like China, back when mobile phones were accessible at the same exact time, credit cards were accessible. It just the way that people were going about purchasing and shopping was built on social before it was built on sites like Amazon. That has become habitual process of purchasing internationally. I don't necessarily think it has taken off in the United States exactly the same way it has internationally, but I think TikTok has been that turning point for buyers, and it's Prime Day every day on TikTok, so to speak. I worry a little bit big picture that the sale of TikTok could cause some people to either lose faith or engagement in the platform long-term, but I don't think that the idea of social commerce and purchasing based on trends or engagement with influencers, whatever it may be, I don't think that trend is going to go away, even if it shifts off of sites like TikTok. I am happy that Amazon has Amazon Web Services, which is generating something like 60% of its operating profit because Amazon, in my opinion, has been very slow to adjust to the social commerce trends. I worry a little bit that as we start to age out of the demographic here for commerce that they're not going to do a great job of convincing younger shoppers that they need to have an Amazon Prime membership.
Dan Caplinger: For me, the question as it goes with TikTok is going to be, what do content producing influencers decide to do? Are they going to take the shift in ownership and treat that as a catalyst to make them consider alternatives? If they do that, then that's going to be a shift, and the marketing will then follow the influencers. I don't think that it's going to be an external decision where external marketers tell influencers that they need to leave TikTok. I think that that's probably going to be an influencer judge decision, and I'll be curious to see how it works out, because if there is a big exodus among influencers from the platform, the question is going to be, what platform do they go to? Then that becomes the next TikTok, and then that becomes the next target of regulation. Where does that circle end?
Jason Hall: All roads lead to AI. AI is going to be doing our shopping for us in five years, guys.
Emily Flippen: I dare to dream there, Jason. If it could take care of my shopping for me, I would definitely take it up on it.

Emily Flippen: I hope everybody has already made their car purchases because September 30th was the last day for Americans to qualify for their federal EV tax credits. Automakers have been dreading this drop off for months now, and it could have come at a worse time. Tesla has really struggled to maintain deliveries. Ford's CEO expects EV sales could drop by half, and BYD just posted its first monthly year-over-year sales decline in more than a year-and-a-half. Jason, do electric vehicles need to shift in policies to drive adoption or is this just a temporary speed bump?
Jason Hall: I think we're about to find out, Emily. I know that's not a direct answer here, and I'm dancing around it a little bit, but I don't think we completely know a couple things. Our cars writ large have continued to become more expensive. Car prices on average are up about 16 new car prices on average are up about 16% since March 2021, according to Kelley Blue Book. That's helping create a little more parity to the cost of an EV versus an internal combustion engine powered car. There's still cost pressures, but the EV industry is starting to benefit from some other things to bring costs down. Higher scale manufacturing for batteries, and then advanced battery technology, they are bringing battery costs down. That's a big thing. I think those things might help over the longer term. We just don't really know how it's going to play out in the near term.
Dan Caplinger: I just don't think that tax credits are necessarily the linchpin of what determines the success in the EV industry at this point. To me, the key to adoption is reliable infrastructure. I'll just tell you, charging anywhere other than Tesla Supercharger Network, it's just a nightmare. I mean, I'm the target audience for this. I would love to drive an electric vehicle, and the electric vehicles that I've driven, I love how they perform. It's just really good acceleration. It's just the handling is great. But I'll tell you, I went to Florida, and the only rental car that they had left was an EV, a non-Tesla EV. It changed the complexion of the entire trip because suddenly, I had range anxiety. I couldn't just up and go to the next city down the coast to go check out the beach there and not think about, OK, am I going to have enough charge to get back in time for dinner? Where am I going to go? What are the charging options going to be? They really need to get the infrastructure up to speed before EV adoption is really going to hit the mainstream. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that's going to happen because at the policy level, we used to have tailwinds that were inspiring companies to spend on improving infrastructure for electric vehicles. That now in the current administration has turned into headwinds, not just on the tax credit side, but just on broader policy priorities and energy policy. With no real appetite for investment, I don't have nearly the expectation for improvement in EV infrastructure that I did a year ago.
Emily Flippen: The economic equation, especially as it applies to energy right now in a more expensive world for energy has gotten more expensive for electric vehicles. Without the incentives, at least as the environment exists right now, it's really hard to make the math work for new car purchases to move electric versus traditional.
Jason Hall: Well, just on the purchaser side, if you look on the manufacturing side, Tesla's bottom line may be hit more because of the loss of some tax credits that they were able to sell to other automakers to offset some tax liability. That's billions of dollars a year in high margin revenue that is going to completely go away. Part of the answer for that Tesla, after we record this today, is supposed to be announcing a lower cost model. Why? I think as much as anything, that's an immediate evidence that the automakers are having to react quickly with cost cuts to be competitive. Let me just say this last thing. Besides Tesla and BYD, find another mass market automaker. I'm throwing Ferrari out here. That's a brand that they're selling. Find an automaker, EV or otherwise, that has been a market beating investments over the past decade, and you will not find them besides again, Tesla and BYD. Most of the other EV stocks, they've wiped out tens of billions in investor value. This is just a tough, brutal industry. Even Tesla's future is less tied to cars and more to AI, autonomy services, robotics, and those sorts of things. They need to make profit from cars to pay for that stuff, but this is just a tough industry. If I were an investor, looking in this space, I would immediately go find somewhere else where the tailwinds are tied to profits. Hey, guys, maybe artificial intelligence. What do you say?
Dan Caplinger: I do have to say, though, Jason, I think that Tesla does have the opportunity to extract even more money for supercharger access to the other automakers for exactly the reasons that you just mentioned. Because of these policy headwinds, that could be a nice addition to Tesla's cash cow business there that could help fund AI, robotics, automation, all those other priorities.
Emily Flippen: Well, as always, I like to sign off here with the lightning rounds. Maybe you'll have some more hot takes for us, Jason. We discussed a lot of things today, electric vehicles, online shopping, tariff policies, so I really want to put you both and myself included on the spot to maybe give one of our favorite stocks that's likely to benefit from one of the broader trends we talked about. Dan, let me go to you first.
Dan Caplinger: I'm going to mention Symbotic. This is ticker SYM on the NASDAQ. It's a company. It's been heavily involved in improving warehouse storage technology, basically automating the warehouse with autonomous robots that help streamline movement of goods inside of those facilities, make the supply chain more efficient. I think that that company potentially benefits both from tariff-related pushes to get more manufacturing and warehousing back onshore, as well as just the overall positive trends in e-commerce over time.
Jason Hall: Well, I've mentioned AI a ton of time, so I might as well stick with that. Dan, you brought up robotics in warehouses, and this just lines up perfectly. Let's talk about Amazon again. It's winning from AI with its own AI-driven products. AWS, a lot of compute to build artificial intelligence is happening at AWS. We know that's the profit driver there, as you mentioned. Emily, it's starting to supercharge its Alexa products with AI. It's using AI to help shoppers. Also, hat tip to Dan on this one. Like I said, guys, it's one of the largest robotics companies on Earth, and people sometimes forget about that. I think it's later this year, if they haven't already passed it, Amazon will have actually deployed more robots in its warehouse than human workers. That's a big leg up in driving those costs down, Dan. Like you said, that helps offset the impact of tariffs and also labor inflation on its bottom line. One last thing, I'll do a little Steve Jobs here, too. Let's not forget about Zoox. That's the autonomous right hailing start-up that Amazon bought back in 2020. Largely, guess what? They got a lot of great AI and robotic stuff that's part of that. Three decades later, Amazon's still square in the middle of all of the innovations that are going to be changing the world for decades to come.
Emily Flippen: Well, now, I feel very insecure about the stock that I was going to go with because I feel sold. I'd never heard of Symbotic before, Dan, and you're staying. Of course, I know Amazon, and maybe my skepticism there on the commerce side is unwarranted, but I was actually going to go with BYD. The ticker is BYDDY.
Jason Hall: One of the only winners in the EV space. This is a great choice.
Emily Flippen: Well, I will say, I take to heart what you mentioned about the fact that cars have traditionally or automobile manufacturers have traditionally not been great investments. It's a pretty heavily commoditized space. They compete really heavily on price. But the reason why I like BYD, I mean, this is a battery company at its heart with a management team that has been incredibly focused on what I think is most important to win in this space, which is efficiency. BYD is really the only low-cost electric vehicle manufacturer that is managing to make vehicles worldwide at a rate that is, in my opinion, accessible to the average person. When we talk about the economic decision making for car purchases, being really against adoption of electric vehicles right now, that means the lowest cost model probably is the one that wins. I'm disappointed that we don't have more updates out from Tesla on the day that we're taping this. We're owed it today. Hasn't come out by the time that we're finishing taping. Maybe Tesla will eventually come out with their low-cost model, but BYD, in my opinion, is just leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to the accessibility of low-cost electric vehicles. That's going, in my opinion, really underappreciated by American investors. Well, fools, we hope that that was a hopefully somewhat interesting and useful podcast. We discussed lots of different topics. Ending here with some of our favorite investments that hopefully everybody could consider potentially adding to their portfolios. Jason and Dan, thank you both so much for joining today.
Dan Caplinger: Thanks, Emily.

Tesla shares riding higher as the EV maker is making some waves in China. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian join us now with more. Pras.
Yes, uh Josh, the Tesla's kind of head in head in China. They're uh uh posting on Weibo that Giga Shanghai is ramping up their Q4 production. You know, this is a uh this is their biggest factory by volume and and Q4 is their biggest time of year for Tesla generally speaking and uh it's good to hear that they're ramping up production there because, you know, demand was potentially questioned
and so it's, you know, with high competition in in China with EVs kind of a problem there. So, you know, look, this follows good and good strong sales for Tesla in September. Uh they had sales up 25% month over month. Uh slightly down year over year, but still still still better than nothing for them. Uh as they sort of uh the Model Y L, which is like the bigger six-passenger, three row Model Y came out that must be they might be helping them out there in China uh ahead of this busy period for them.
Speaking of Tesla, new buy rating apparently, Melius Research. What's going on there?
Yeah, I seen a seen Melius Research uh launched covers the buy rating, $520 price target. That's a pretty big, pretty big premium there. Uh, they said quote, we see Tesla shares as a must own. Uh the disruptive force of AI will wreck multi-million multi-trillion dollar industry starting with autos.
Yeah, that sounds almost Dan Ives-like.
Well, they see it as a disruptive force, I guess, right? Uh, you know, speaking of Ives, you know, he sees this AI opportunity as a trillion dollar opportunity. Uh, Adam Jonas and Morgan Stanley, same deal, right? All about the AI bet with Tesla, robots, uh robo taxis, uh AI, XAI combination. So it's all it's all there. It's everything you want to hear if you're an investor and don't care about fundamentals.
Well, let let let let's talk about that. I mean, it is interesting with Tesla. We were talking off camera about this. You research and buy ratings. Do fundamentals actually matter with this name?
I think I think Melius said that it's really kind of like out the window. You don't really you can't really gauge it that way. Uh and Dan Levy uh Barclays said that quote that Tesla was the OG meme stock
because because of the fact that it doesn't trade on fundamentals, but it's also because it's so high in in retail ownership. You know, high high conviction retail owners, investors who own the stock and don't tell them anything bad about Tesla. They they're very they they they believe in the cause.
But so many so many folks who buy it, they're believers in Musk and in the vision Musk has laid out. That's what they're buying into.
Yeah, and they say look look at the past 10 years of Tesla stock, right? It's it's like this, right? So they say, hey, he's made me money in the past. I believe in him, he's a vision he's a true visionary. Uh I think I just saw that they, you know, you know the Colossus uh AI data center, he's calling the project Macro hard as a swipe at Microsoft, right? It's going to be doing not just AI, but physical AI stuff too, whatever that means. hardware. So a lot going on in the world of Tesla, but yes, it's not tethered to the fundamentals.
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of the Tesla earnings, aren't they on deck? When are they coming?
Yeah, next week, 22nd after the bell, we'll be here.
Um, what are you going to be watching for on that?
You know, I think it's going to have to be in the near term it's going to have to be, what's happening with the robo taxi rollout? Are we going to see more cities? Are they going to take away the safe drivers, right? That's the first stage in the AI stuff, right? Because we're not Optimus is a long way to go, right? Uh Optimus and the AI that sort of the embodied AI that sort of controls these objects is the next step and um I think the robo taxi, Cyber Cybercab. What's the deal with Cybercab? Is that actually
planned for 2026 production? Is that still on track? Apparently they've seen the cars go around the test track, right? So that's it's happening, but we want to get more, like you said, future looking stuff, not just like, oh, Q4 sales, no one really cares, right?
All right, thank you, Pras. Appreciate it."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) has started ramping up production at its Shanghai gigafactory for the fourth quarter, Vice President Tao Lin said Monday in a post on Weibo.
The facility Teslas largest manufacturing hub worldwide is increasing output after the automaker saw an improvement in China-made vehicle sales last month. September deliveries of locally built cars rose 2.8% from a year earlier, ending a two-month decline in the Chinese market.
The modest rebound follows the start of deliveries for Teslas new six-seater vehicle in China, which helped lift showroom traffic and domestic demand. The company continues to rely heavily on its Shanghai plant to supply both Chinese buyers and export markets across Asia and Europe.
The production ramp comes as Tesla works to stabilize global output and strengthen margins after several months of uneven sales in key markets. Investors will be watching the companys third-quarter earnings later this month for updates on production targets and new model timelines."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could soon find itself at the center of Dubai's next big transportation experiment. In what may become the Boring Company's most ambitious project yet, the UAE's Minister for Artificial Intelligence, Omar Al Olama, said the first phase of the Dubai Loop is expected to go live by the second quarter of 2026. The 17-kilometer system, designed to carry up to 20,000 passengers an hour, is part of Dubai's broader push to reinvent urban mobilitypairing Musk's tunneling vision with the city's obsession for futuristic infrastructure, from air taxis to AI-powered traffic systems.
For Musk, the Dubai Loop could be a proving ground. The Boring Company's only operational system so far runs in Las Vegas, where Tesla vehicles drive passengers through short underground tunnels. It's not yet known whether Dubai's version will also rely on Tesla cars or switch to autonomous pods, but either way, the project could give Musk's tunneling venture new global credibility after years of mixed progress. The company's lead architect departed in September, adding uncertainty to execution timelines, yet Dubai's willingness to bet on bold tech concepts could provide the right environment for Musk's latest gamble.
At the same time, the UAE is accelerating its own AI playbook. Al Olama confirmed that the country expects to receive its first shipment of Nvidia's advanced AI chips before the end of the yearchips that could help power OpenAI's Stargate project, a five-gigawatt data-center partnership with Oracle and others. U.S. officials recently cleared billions of dollars' worth of chip exports for American firms operating in the Emirates, potentially positioning the UAE as one of the most active global hubs for AI infrastructure and advanced computing."

A trader who attracted attention for successfully shorting Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) just before the recent crash added to their position even as the market rebounded on Sunday.
Investor Doubles Down On Bearish Position
The investor opened the position at $117,369 and was sitting on an unrealized profit of $3.70 million as of this writing, according to decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid. The trader took a 10x leverage bet to boost the position's value to over $163 million.
If Bitcoin reaches $123,510, which is 7.59% away from its current price, the trader will be liquidated.
Interestingly, the bet was taken despite the market’s sharp rebound, with Bitcoin regaining $115,000 on Sunday.

Signs Of Insider Trading?
The whale grabbed headlines after opening multi-million dollar short positions on BTC and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) right before President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China.
The cryptocurrency market tumbled in response and the trader subsequently closed most of their short positions, netting a profit of $160 million.
Reacting to the development, capital markets commentator The Kobeissi Letter said, ""Did Someone Know?""
This is not the first time that suspicions of insider trading have been raised in relation to Trump’s posts.
Earlier in March, a trader opened a 50x leveraged bet on Bitcoin and Ethereum shortly before Trump announced a cryptocurrency reserve, turning an investment of $4 million into a $200 million position.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.
SoFi Alt Investments
SoFi gives membersaccess to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.
Range Wealth Management
Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold
For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides asimple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets."

President Donald Trump's past remarks about Bitcoin's potential to ""save America"" deserve scrutiny: what it would actually take for the cryptocurrency to cover the $37 trillion U.S. national debt?
Bitcoin Would Need $1.8 Million To Match U.S. Debt
Trump has previously suggested the nation’s debt burden could be paid off with Bitcoin.
But according to calculations based on Treasury data and blockchain supply metrics, Bitcoin's circulating supply of roughly 19.93 million coins would need to reach a combined value of $37 trillion to offset the U.S. debt load.
That implies an average price of nearly $1.86 million per BTC, based on the current supply figures compiled by MacroMicro and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Trending: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.81 a Share
At today's levels, Bitcoin trades near $112,000, giving it a market capitalization of about $2.23 trillion — a fraction of what would be needed.
Even on paper, the market cap required to match U.S. debt is astronomical, and converting that value into actual dollars would be impossible without crashing the market.
Liquidity And Market Depth Make It Unworkable
Economists say even if Bitcoin were to reach such valuations, converting that amount of crypto into cash would be self-defeating.
Large-scale liquidation would erode liquidity and trigger cascading selloffs long before the government could access the full value.
Additionally, a large portion of Bitcoin's supply is considered illiquid — locked in long-term wallets, lost keys, or institutional reserves.
Estimates suggest more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is effectively unrecoverable, further reducing available liquidity.
Beyond market dynamics, there are also legal and political constraints.
The U.S. government cannot forcibly seize or monetize all privately held Bitcoin without massive backlash and constitutional challenges.

Economic Fallout Would Overshadow The Goal
Analysts note that even if Bitcoin's market value equaled $37 trillion, attempting to convert that theoretical wealth into dollars would destabilize global markets.
Selling that volume into any trading venue would collapse prices, trigger derivatives losses, and potentially ignite systemic contagion across currencies and equities.
The Peterson Foundation has warned that fiscal solutions depend on sustainable economic growth and policy reform — not speculative asset revaluations."

Oct 13 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rebounded in U.S. trading Monday, gaining nearly 3% after a weekend message from former President Donald Trump suggested a less confrontational approach toward China.
The move followed a sharp 5% loss on Friday, when trade worries rattled markets after Beijing hinted it may limit rare earth exports. Trump's later comments on Truth Social, saying both he and Chinese President Xi Jinping wanted to avoid economic distress, helped ease investor concerns.
Despite limited imports from China, Tesla's operations there remain crucial. The company sold about 263,000 vehicles in China during the first half of 2025, close to 40% of its total global deliveries, driven by strong output from its Shanghai factory.
Investors have recently shifted focus from trade risks to Tesla's growing artificial intelligence ventures. The electric vehicle maker began its AI-powered robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June and is planning to expand nationwide.
Tesla shares have advanced roughly 2% in 2025 and are up about 90% over the past year, even as valuations stretch to around 165 times projected 2026 earnings, according to FactSet estimates.
Is TSLA Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 44 analysts, the average target price for Tesla Inc is $350.68 with a high estimate of $600.00 and a low estimate of $120.00. The average target implies a downside of -15.19% from the current price of $413.49.

Just because a business has cash doesn’t mean it’s a good investment. Luckily, StockStory is here to help you separate the winners from the losers. Keeping that in mind, here are two companies with net cash positions that can leverage their balance sheets to grow and one with hidden risks.
One Stock to Sell:
Tesla (TSLA)
Net Cash Position: $29.56 billion (2.2% of Market Cap)
Originally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
Why Is TSLA Risky?
-
Tesla's scale advantage in EV production leads to gross margins that exceed incumbents such as General Motors and Ford. However, a softer macroeconomic backdrop and tariff pressures have weighed on automobile sales, which are highly cyclical.
-
The company's execution ability is a question mark given its long history of delays, such as the Cybertruck and Robotaxi launches. Its sizeable investments in projects with uncertain return timelines, like Optimus, also raise skepticism from investors.
-
On the bright side, Tesla's Megapack product solves a critical problem for utilities needing renewable energy storage solutions. This innovation has made the energy segment the most profitable and fastest-growing business line for the company.
At $428.34 per share, Tesla trades at 200.8x forward price-to-earnings. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than TSLA.
Two Stocks to Watch:
Monster (MNST)
Net Cash Position: $1.87 billion (2.8% of Market Cap)
Founded in 2002 as a natural soda and juice company, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is a pioneer of the energy drink category, and its Monster Energy brand targets a young, active demographic.
Why Are We Bullish on MNST?
-
Highly efficient business model is illustrated by its impressive 27.5% operating margin
-
Strong free cash flow margin of 22.6% enables it to reinvest or return capital consistently, and its growing cash flow gives it even more resources to deploy
-
Stellar returns on capital showcase management’s ability to surface highly profitable business ventures
Monster’s stock price of $68.06 implies a valuation ratio of 34.5x forward P/E. Is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it’s free for active Edge members.

South Korean investors turned their Chuseok holiday into a week of aggressive risk-taking, funneling $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets while domestic markets were closed between October 3 and 9.
Key Takeaways:
- South Korean investors poured $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets during the Chuseok holiday week.
- Top buys included Tesla, Meta, and Bitcoin mining stocks, with leveraged ETFs leading the surge.
- The buying spree ended abruptly as US–China trade tensions triggered a global market pullback.
Instead of taking time off during the country’s Thanksgiving break, retail investors piled into leveraged ETFs and high-growth stocks, according to data from the Korea Securities Depository.
Korean Investors Flock to Tesla, Meta, and Bitcoin Miner Stocks
The most popular target was the Direxion Daily Tesla Bull 2X ETF, a leveraged fund that amplifies Tesla’s stock movements, with net purchases totaling $151 million.
Other top buys included $105 million in Iris Energy, an Australian Bitcoin mining firm; $100 million in Meta Platforms, and $96 million in Tesla shares themselves.
Another leveraged crypto play, the T-REX 2X Long BMNR Daily Target ETF, which tracks Bitmine Immersion Technologies with double exposure, ranked fifth among foreign purchases at around $95 million.
The spree followed a strong rally in Seoul, where the Kospi Index hit new highs before the holiday amid optimism over US tech resilience and local stimulus plans.
With Korean exchanges closed, that bullish sentiment appeared to spill overseas as investors chased Wall Street’s momentum.
But timing may have worked against them. The surge in cross-border buying came just days before global markets tumbled on renewed US–China trade tensions, erasing part of the previous week’s gains.
Analysts say it remains to be seen whether Korean retail traders, known for their risk appetite and agility, will maintain such aggressive exposure.
The Kospi reopened 1.7% lower on Monday, slipping back below the 3,600 level and hinting that the Chuseok rally may have been short-lived.
South Korea Orders Crypto Exchanges to Halt Lending Services
In August, South Korea’s financial regulator moved to rein in risky lending practices in the digital asset sector, ordering local exchanges to suspend all crypto lending services until a proper regulatory framework is established.
The crackdown came amid South Korea’s broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country’s first spot crypto ETFs.
President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs.
More recently, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions.
The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

Clearly, this is on the back of NVIDIA's (NVDA) explosive growth which saw sales grow by ten times in the same period to $165 billion as of the July quarter, on its way to cross $205 billion this fiscal year (ends January).
Of course, demand for NVIDIA GPU systems didn't turn into a hockey stick until its ""ChatGPT moment"" in the spring of 2023.
I mark that moment in late May at Computex in Taipei City, Taiwan when Jensen Huang unveiled the DGX Grace Hopper 200 system and said that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms (META) were already in line.
To me, this meant that the other 996 corporations in the Fortune 1,000 would want (or need) to build their own LLMs too. I then published this article and video to explain what was coming...
Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion
And that $2 trillion market cap came quickly. That's when the ""AI bubble"" talk started. You can imagine how astonished the bubble breathers are now that NVDA is approaching a $5 trillion market cap.
""Honey, I Shrunk the Chips!""
While Apple's business has been significant for TSMC (as much as 25% of revenues), the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in the low single digits.
What still makes Apple very important though is how they help drive innovation at TSMC by always demanding the latest and greatest architectures for their ecosystem of devices.
TSMC supplies chips for flagship smartphones and 5G infrastructure, where efficiency and miniaturization are crucial. The company’s 5nm and 3nm transistor nodes are widely adopted in high-end mobile devices and 5G equipment, supporting the global rollout of next-generation connectivity.
Transistor nodes refer to the specific manufacturing processes used to produce integrated circuits, where the ""nm"" (nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) like 7nm or 5nm, historically represented a physical dimension of the transistor, specifically the gate length. For reference, the coronavirus is about 50nm.
Now it's more of a marketing term that signifies a new generation of chip technology with improved performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
But generally, a smaller node number means...
Smaller transistors: More transistors can be packed into the same area on a chip.
Faster switching: Electrons have a shorter distance to travel, leading to higher clock speeds.
Lower power consumption: Less voltage is needed to operate the smaller transistors.
Why the AI Economy is Not a Bubble
Which brings us back to NVIDIA as they now pack 208 billion transistors into the Grace Blackwell ""superchip"" with further density on the horizon in the Rubin and Feynman series of GPUs expected in 2026 and 2027, following Jensen's nearly annual cadence of development.
I mentioned the early demand for NVIDIA systems in 2023 and have recently seen similar projections from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Marvell (MRVL) at their Custom AI Investor Event that total datacenter capex by the big ""hyperscalers"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) plus Meta, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI, Apple, and xAI, will grow from nearly $600 billion this year to over $1 trillion in 2028.
This demand is not slowing down because all these companies realize that the transition to an ""AI economy"" is built on the infrastructure of NVIDIA GPU systems. I am on record late last year saying that this megatrend would lead to over $500 billion in revenues for NVIDIA by 2030. That's only ~35% CAGR from when the TTM topline crossed $100 billion.
And Citi just updated their industry outlook in their ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Energy"" report. The bank forecasts global AI infra capex at $5.5 trillion cumulative through 2029 (56% CAGR), hitting $2.16T in 2029 alone. So that's a double from 2028's $1 trillion.
And that's the infrastructure to power not just generative and agentic AI systems (i.e., LLMs), but a whole new world of ""physical AI"" for autonomous machines, including self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and many other types of 3D automation requiring ""embodied"" or edge intelligence and vision/spatial perception.
And of course my favorite use cases for these technologies are science and medicine, where researchers can plumb the depths of our existence and come back with wondrous and life-changing knowledge.
The training alone for these worlds requires enormous datasets and compute, using simulation and synthetic models. In this way, Jensen is forging a new universe of possibilities that keep TSMC ""fabs"" humming.
TSMC is the Backbone of the AI Economy
TSMC holds about 67% of the global foundry market and nearly 90% of advanced chip production, making it the preferred manufacturer for high-performance, custom AI accelerators and GPUs.
While NVIDIA designs the magical GPUs and systems that power the innovations of the AI Economy, it all starts with Taiwan Semi's advanced silicon fabrication. This is the epitome of high-tech manufacturing using lithographic etching to create circuits smaller than the eye can see.
And what's better for crafting new chips than brand new ""fabs"" as TSMC just broke ground on their 3rd facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In late June, Softbank's Masayoshi Son announced new plans to invest in a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and AI technologies.
Son is seeking to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which concentrates high-tech companies for proximity of resources, logistics, R&D, collaboration, and talent. TSMC was named as a key partner in Son's plans.
Currently for TSMC, the 5nm and 3nm nodes are the backbone for state-of-the-art AI accelerators, powering chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple that are used in generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
In Q1 2025, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from 3nm and 5nm nodes, with 73% from 7nm and below, underscoring the centrality of these advanced processes in TSMC's business and the broader tech ecosystem.
But TSMC wouldn't be itself if it wasn't planning to go deeper. The company plans to begin production of its 2nm node by late 2025, promising significant gains in power efficiency and performance. Looking further ahead, mass production of the 1.4nm (14 angstroms) process is slated for 2028, offering 10–15% higher speeds or 25–30% lower energy use compared to 2nm."

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 3.4% in the afternoon session after Melius Research initiated coverage on the stock with a ""Buy"" rating and a price target of $520. This optimistic view was supported by another analyst action, as Evercore ISI Group raised its price target on the company's shares from $235 to $300, although it kept its ""In-Line"" rating.
Additionally, a company executive announced (according to Reuters) Tesla's key Shanghai factory will ramp up production in the fourth quarter, signaling an increased ability to meet strong global demand. This boost in potential output suggests higher future revenues.
Contributing to the positive momentum, the major indices rebounded as signs of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China emerged over the weekend.
The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite jumped around 1.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.2%. This rebound follows a significant sell-off the previous trading day, which saw the Nasdaq plummet 3.6% and the S&P 500 sink 2.7% after threats of new tariffs heightened fears of a trade war. Investor sentiment improved after the U.S. President adopted a more conciliatory tone toward Beijing in a social media post. The shift in language helped calm market jitters and spurred a broad-based rally as investors welcomed the potential de-escalation of the trade dispute.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $426.78, up 3.3% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 48 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 3.3% on the news that the company unveiled a more affordable, stripped-down version of its Model Y, which disappointed investors who had hoped for an entirely new vehicle.
The move followed a 5.5% gain in the previous trading session, which was fueled by speculation over a teased product launch. However, the reveal of cheaper versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively, was met with less enthusiasm. The new variants were seen as a move to revive demand after the expiration of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September.
Also, a confluence of negative economic data pointed to a weak economy. The latest Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Fed revealed that households' short-term inflation expectations are rising, while their outlook on the labor market is deteriorating. Consumers expressed greater concern about potential job losses and expect lower earnings growth, factors that directly impact discretionary spending."

But Tesla is also making some waves in China.
As reported by Reuters, Tesla vice president Tao Lin posted on Weibo that Tesla's Shanghai gigafactory began its fourth quarter production ramp-up. Typically, Q4 is Tesla’s biggest quarter in terms of deliveries, and Shanghai is its largest assembly facility by volume, as it supports mainland China and other regions of the world.
Confirmation that production is ramping up at Tesla’s largest facility is a shot in the arm for the electric vehicle maker as concerns grow over demand issues and increased competition in Asia and greater Europe.
Tesla stock gained over 5% on Monday.
In China, Tesla sales in September were strong. Per CNEVPost, Tesla sold 71,525 vehicles in the month, its second-highest monthly total this year behind March's 74,127 tally, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). September’s total was a 25% jump from August, though sales were down less than 1% year over year.
Tesla’s EV market share climbed slightly to 8.66% from 8.33%, CPCA said. Powering some of those gains is the new Model YL, Tesla’s larger Model Y variant for the Chinese market.
The three-row, six-seat Model YL launched in August with deliveries starting in early September. The new six-seater allows Tesla to compete in the larger EV SUV segment in China.
The boost in the YL could be seen in Tesla’s China-made Model Y wholesale figures (which include exports), which jumped 17% to 59,000 units in September.
Growing enthusiasm in China, strong Q3 delivery numbers, and the booming artificial intelligence trade sent Tesla shares soaring over 30% last month. The question is whether Tesla can maintain that momentum heading into the fall, when the loss of the federal EV tax credit will likely blunt sales in the US.
As with Tesla, fundamentals don’t really matter when it comes to stock moves.
Tesla is the “OG Meme stock,” according to Barclays' Dan Levy, and its legion of retail investors keeps it that way.
“There is a very robust retail following driving it. In many ways, we’ve said the fundamentals just don’t matter. That’s why the stock trades at a nonsensical P/E multiple,” Levy said on CNBC. ""There are other technical factors driving it, including 'Mag 7' relative performance and option activity, which matter more than the typical fundamentals.”
Tesla will give investors another reason to buy (or sell) the stock when it reports earnings after the bell on Oct. 22."

Gen X may be about to make history, but not in the way they hoped. Caught between rising job losses, disappearing social safety nets and growing automation, many in this generation are facing a terrifying possibility: being pushed out of the workforce with no apparent way back in.
A Generation On The Edge
Sociologists Annette Nierobisz and Dana Sawchuk interviewed dozens of baby boomers who lost white-collar jobs during the 2008 recession. Many were, in their words, ""too young to retire but too old to start all over."" The same now applies to Gen X, who may be even worse off, as they argue in a recent The Hill op-ed. In it, they warn that Gen Xers face heightened financial risk due to diminished job security, draining retirement accounts, and limited social support compared to earlier generations.

The authors found that some older workers managed ""soft landings,"" thanks to pensions, generous severance packages, or support from family. But those benefits are rare today. Gen X entered the workforce as stable, long-term jobs were being replaced with temp work, contract gigs and 401(k)s instead of pensions.
Nierobisz and Sawchuk argue that retraining alone won't be enough. Older workers already face age discrimination. And when jobs vanish faster than new ones are created, reskilling becomes a losing game.
""It's impossible to prepare for a bout of unemployment extended indefinitely by age discrimination in the hiring process,"" they wrote.

Will UBI Become A Necessity?
The authors argue that Gen X may be the tipping point for considering universal basic income as a structural solution to long-term job loss. Based on their interviews and broader research, they say the financial realities facing Gen X make it far more vulnerable to lasting harm after a layoff.
That leaves UBI as a serious option, not as a futuristic experiment, but as a necessary support for people who fall through the cracks. The idea is gaining traction in some U.S. cities, and international experiments have shown improvements in well-being and employment stability.
The key argument is that if AI is going to replace work, then income has to be separated from employment. For Gen Xers aging out of the job market without a pension, safety net or viable second act, UBI could be the only thing standing between stability and financial collapse."

This rating came ahead of the company’s Q3 2025 earnings report. As for Q2, Tesla reported making $22.50 billion in total sales. This represented an 11.78% decline year-over-year.
However, the company’s automotive revenue saw a 19% sequential increase, with total vehicle deliveries improving by 14%. The company generated $146 million in free cash flow. Despite these gains, costs were impacted by tariffs, resulting in a sequential cost increase of $300 million for both the automotive and energy sectors, with further increases anticipated.
Additionally, the impending expiration of consumer credits for residential storage by the end of the year poses challenges to the energy business. The company anticipated potentially rough quarters ahead due to the loss of US incentives and the inherent risks of being in the early stages of autonomy development.
Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles and energy generation & storage systems in the US, China, and internationally.

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Global trade tensions are sending shock waves across the markets this morning, and it's not all about Trump. The Netherlands took an unprecedented step against a Chinese company to defend its national security.
Chinese chip manufacturer Wingtech, which owns Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, plunged more than 10% in Shanghai after the Dutch government took control of its local unit. It's a sign that Europe is joining Washington in tightening its grip on strategic technology. The move also sent a chill across semiconductor names globally, reminding investors that geopolitics now moves the needle in the tech trade.
Now, Tesla isn't the only EV company that's struggling with handle design. China's Xiaomi, which has staged an impressive rally this year, saw shares fall sharply in Asia trading after a tragic fatal crash. The driver of a Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan was locked inside the vehicle and bystanders weren't able to rescue him.
The company didn't immediately comment. Moving on now, two big gainers you need to know about. Big Bear.ai is climbing after confirming a new US Navy contract to expand the use of its artificial intelligence tools for fleet data analytics and mission planning. Applied Digital continues to attract attention for its data center build outs, powering AI infrastructure for clients like CoreWeave. What stands out about Applied Digital is its resilience even in a tough cycle.

While electric vehicles (EVs) are widely expected to eventually replace their gasoline-powered counterparts, the road to mainstream acceptance has been much choppier than anticipated.
The Trump administration's reduction in EV industry support has made things even harder for smaller, unprofitable players like Lucid, which are trying to transition to the mass market. Let's assess the company's challenges and opportunities to decide if it is finally time to buy.
Lucid's luxury focus is a double-edged sword
Following in the steps of industry leader Tesla, many upstart EV manufacturers have attempted to launch their own brands at the higher end of the market, offering luxury instead of practicality. There are several benefits to this strategy.
For starters, it helps these companies establish cachet and a reputation for quality when their brand image is just being formed. Furthermore, it allows them to slowly ramp up production until they are large enough to benefit from economies of scale.
Lucid's products are notably expensive, with the MSRP of its flagship 2025 Lucid Air Sedan running from $71,400 to $250,500, depending on specifications. And even though the car has won plenty of industry awards, its high-end price tag means a smaller potential customer base.
The company is tackling this problem by diversifying its lineup into SUVs with the new Lucid Gravity. But with a starting MSRP of $94,900, this still serves the higher end of the market. A lower-trim (but still relatively pricey) touring version of the vehicle will start at $79,900.
Lucid's sales are starting to accelerate
Despite the high price tags of its vehicles, Lucid's sales are starting to pick up. Second-quarter revenue jumped 29% year over year to $259.4 million, driven in part by the popularity of the company's new SUVs. And while Lucid is still burning through boatloads of cash, the situation is rapidly improving, with operating losses halving to $803 million.
That being said, the company is still very far from profitability. And that means investors should expect equity dilution, which is when a company creates and sells new units of stock to raise money. While this can be a neutral or positive thing if that extra cash is used to create value (or prevent bankruptcy), it often hurts existing investors by reducing their ownership stake in the company and their claim on its future earnings.
Lucid has raised capital several times in the past with the help of the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), which now owns over 60% of its equity, according to Reuters. And while Lucid can definitely benefit from having a powerful government-connected backer, future capital raises to the PIF could increase the risk that the stock is taken private before retail investors get to enjoy its potential rebound.
Lucid can win over the next five years
There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic about Lucid over the next five years and beyond. For starters, the early popularity of its new Gravity SUV is a good sign. Sales could accelerate even further when the lower-priced touring trim becomes available. Furthermore, unlike mass market alternatives like the Tesla Model Y, demand for Lucid's products is less vulnerable to the loss of the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases, which expired in September.
But Lucid is not out of the woods yet, and investors may benefit from a wait- and-see approach before considering a position in the stock."

Financial flexibility is valuable, but it’s not everything - at StockStory, we help you find the stocks that can not only survive but also outperform. That said, here are two companies with net cash positions that can continue growing sustainably and one that may struggle.
One Stock to Sell:
Tesla (TSLA)
Net Cash Position: $29.56 billion (2.2% of Market Cap)
Originally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
Why Do We Steer Clear of TSLA?
-
Tesla's scale advantage in EV production leads to gross margins that exceed incumbents such as General Motors and Ford. However, a softer macroeconomic backdrop and tariff pressures have weighed on automobile sales, which are highly cyclical.
-
The company's execution ability is a question mark given its long history of delays, such as the Cybertruck and Robotaxi launches. Its sizeable investments in projects with uncertain return timelines, like Optimus, also raise skepticism from investors.
-
On the bright side, Tesla's Megapack product solves a critical problem for utilities needing renewable energy storage solutions. This innovation has made the energy segment the most profitable and fastest-growing business line for the company.
Tesla is trading at $425.10 per share, or 200.8x forward price-to-earnings. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including TSLA in your portfolio, it’s free for active Edge members.
Two Stocks to Watch:

Founded in 2002 as a natural soda and juice company, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is a pioneer of the energy drink category, and its Monster Energy brand targets a young, active demographic.
Why Do We Love MNST?
-
Healthy operating margin of 27.5% shows it’s a well-run company with efficient processes
-
Robust free cash flow margin of 22.6% gives it many options for capital deployment, and its growing cash flow gives it even more resources to deploy
-
Industry-leading 37.6% return on capital demonstrates management’s skill in finding high-return investments

The event comes just as concerns are building that Oracle is sacrificing profitability for growth from renting computing power to AI companies like OpenAI. Last week, the Information reported Oracle’s cloud margins are lower than many on Wall Street are modeling, sending Oracle shares down as much as 7.1% on Tuesday. Even though the stock quickly recovered the losses, there are lingering questions about the economics of the business, which Oracle has forecast will see revenue jump 700% in the coming three fiscal years.
“There are absolutely investors who are concerned about margins, or concerned its targets are very aggressive,” said Mark Martiak, senior partner and financial adviser at Prudential Advisors, whose parent company has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management. “This is an opportunity for Oracle to ease concerns, since a lot of skeptics see the valuation as stretched, especially if a mega-deal like the one it has with OpenAI doesn’t deliver sustained revenue.”
Tuesday will feature a keynote address from recently named co-CEO Mike Sicilia, as well as one from founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison, whose stake in Oracle briefly made him the world’s richest person last month. On Thursday, an investor day is expected to bring updated financial targets.
Hopes are high among many on Wall Street. The conference will be “a major catalyst where the company will clarify many of these debates,” Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi wrote in a note last week, referring to questions over margins. Bernstein’s Mark Moerdler expects “additional details which should help put some of these issues to bed.”
Heavy demand for cloud computing has boosted Oracle’s overall sales, but the big investments required to support it have weighed on profitability. Oracle’s revenue growth is projected to jump to 17% in its current fiscal year, from 8% the year before, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. However, gross margin, which excludes operating expenses, is expected to fall more than 2 percentage points to 68.4%. As recently as fiscal 2021, Oracle’s gross margin was above 80%."

About to Leave Tesla in the Dust?,"Tesla put up a fight and unleashed a strong third-quarter delivery result, but BYD might continue speeding ahead for the rest of 2025.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=40baf181978058a10ba09c0b8e7a8ddb8217e895118760c3223edd035a79e3c5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/is-byd-co-about-to-leave-tesla-in-the-dust/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/is-byd-co-about-to-leave-tesla-in-the-dust/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/is-byd-co-about-to-leave-tesla-in-the-dust/,fool.com,200,,"It's been a pretty wild roller-coaster ride for Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) investors in 2025. The company has dealt with a plethora of developments, both bad and good, sending its share price plunging through the first three months of the year before rebounding 40% during the third quarter.
The good news is that Tesla posted strong third quarter results, but the bad news for Tesla is that BYD (BYDDY 2.30%) is likely still going to far outpace its rival for the full year. Here's a look at the important details.
It's not wise to look at just one quarter
Tesla reported a 7% increase in third-quarter deliveries, compared to the prior year, as many consumers flocked to dealerships to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit. While the influx of buyers was welcomed during the third quarter, there will likely be an equally strong lull in demand during the fourth quarter as consumers grapple with a new pricing reality that doesn't include the tax credit unless under special leasing circumstances.
Tesla's total deliveries reached 497,099 during the third quarter, with production at 447,450 vehicles. With production volume declining compared to the prior year, Tesla was able to work down some inventory ahead of the likely fourth-quarter slowdown. EV makers with a large surplus of inventory heading into October would be in a much tougher position and likely require extra incentives or discounts to move product -- not financially healthy, nor supportive of margins.
Tesla's third-quarter delivery result was plenty to top estimates. However, despite topping estimates, it's clear Tesla is facing a global slowdown in deliveries. In fact, Tesla's deliveries reached 1.2 million through the first three quarters of 2025, down from 2023 and 2024, which both posted about 1.8 million, and even lower than 2022's 1.3 million.
The EV maker's third quarter was partially held back by a continued sales slump in Europe, which has been plagued by consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activism and rhetoric, as well as increased competition from competitors such as Volkswagen and BYD.
Speaking of BYD
While Tesla managed to sell a record number of vehicles during the third quarter, BYD Co. still has the upper hand. China's juggernaut EV maker has now delivered more full-electric vehicles globally than Tesla for four consecutive quarters, and this result was despite BYD registering its first total sales decline in 18 months during September.
The third quarter sets BYD up to do something it has yet to achieve: Outsell Tesla in battery electric vehicles for a full calendar year. Through the first three quarters of 2025, BYD has sold nearly 390,000 more EVs than Tesla.
All that said, and despite strong third-quarter results, the future is filled with speed bumps for each global EV powerhouse. On BYD's end of things, the company is losing momentum in its home Chinese market, where there is an ongoing and brutal price war eroding margins across the industry. Remember that BYD surprised investors with a 30% drop in quarterly profit when it reported in late August.
On Tesla's end, it will have an incredibly difficult time matching the third-quarter surge as the U.S. phased out the $7,500 federal tax credit at the end of September.
Is BYD a buy?
BYD, seeing the signs across the globe, has lowered its sales goal for 2025 to 4.6 million fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. If you're keeping track, that's roughly 1 million vehicles lower than its previous target. Despite the dent in BYD's once seemingly impenetrable armor, the company is still well positioned to thrive long term, especially once the price war in China abates, whether through industry consolidation or other means.
BYD is expanding its brands into higher-margin ultra-premium vehicles, controls its supply chain, makes many of its vehicle parts in-house for vertical integration, localizes production, and adapts its vehicles in a wide range of markets. BYD also offers investors a bit of diversification compared to traditional EV makers that focus solely on passenger cars. BYD also sells buses, forklifts, high-speed trains, and even boasts utility-scale energy storage solutions.
Despite headwinds in its home market, the Chinese EV maker is poised to surge past Tesla's deliveries for the full calendar year, remains well positioned globally with a proven market growth strategy, and still has plenty of long-term upside considering it has yet to dabble in the valuable U.S. market. BYD remains an excellent investment option in the automotive industry."

Cramer’s comments about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in this episode were interesting when viewed in the context of his earlier remarks. Previously, he has asserted that the firm is more of a technology and robotics company instead of a car company. However, this time he shared that discussing Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s vehicle deliveries was also important after co-host Carl Quintanilla pointed towards meek share price performance following the firm’s latest presentation and event. During the event, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced new versions of its Model 3 and Model Y, which were the entry-level variants of its vehicles:
“Well that’s because Daniel Ives wasn’t there to promote it. He was there and didn’t say the things, of course Tesla’s up a bit. I would say that remember, we are really in the tech mode, we’re in the autonomous drive, we’re in the software mode. Somehow, we’re not even talking about the sales. I think we should be talking about the sales. I’m looking at the BMW sales and they’re just awful.”

Blow-out quarterly earnings estimates from American software and cloud services specialist Oracle, a $100bn (£75bn) investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI by silicon chip designer Nvidia and, in reverse, the purchase of a 10pc stake by OpenAI in another semiconductor maker, AMD, are all keeping the artificial intelligence (AI) pot boiling, so far as stock markets are concerned.
The magnificent seven of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla now have an aggregate stock market capitalisation of $21tn – or 36pc of the S&P 500 index’s total value. Their spending on AI and their share prices are firing US economic growth, which continues to shrug off tariff turmoil, corporate earnings – and thus, the US stock market.
In theory, where the US goes, the rest are sure to follow. America is the world’s largest economy and home to its biggest stock market, biggest bond market and its reserve currency the dollar, all of which count for rather a lot. Many headline stock indices are cruising to new highs, including our very own FTSE 100.
Yet someone is worried. The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), released last Wednesday, offer warnings of increased risks of a sharp pullback in global share prices. The question now, as one email sent to this column immediately reflected, is whether this is a timely alert or a repeat of Alan Greenspan’s “irrational exuberance” speech of 1996. The then-Federal Reserve chair cautioned about the dangers of a galloping stock market, only for share prices to continue rising, not peaking until 39 months later.
Uncanny echoes
The FPC’s frets about the sky-high valuations of anything AI carry uncomfortable echoes of the technology, media and telecoms (TMT) – or dotcom – bubble that inflated over the 1990s, popped in 2000 and bottomed in 2002. It then took America’s technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index, the poster child for the bubble, until April 2015 to return to its March 2000 high, teaching investors a painful lesson of the perils of choosing narrative over valuation.
Greenspan had, in the eyes of some, tried to calm animal spirits before the bubble even got going – and with good reason. Just eight months after the Fed chair spoke, trouble blew in from an unexpected quarter when Thailand devalued the baht. Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia quickly followed with the rupiah, won and ringgit, and the Asian debt crisis began to roil markets."

Why Do We Think Tesla Will Underperform?
We’re happy investors have made money, but we're sitting this one out for now. Here are three reasons you should be careful with TSLA and a stock we'd rather own.
1. Weak Sales Volumes Indicate Waning Demand
Revenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful Automobile Manufacturing company because there’s a ceiling to what customers will pay.
Tesla’s units sold came in at 384,122 in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, they grew by 1.2% annually. This performance was underwhelming and suggests it might have to lower prices or invest in product improvements to accelerate growth, factors that can hinder near-term profitability.
2. Free Cash Flow Margin Dropping
If you’ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills or invest for the future.
As you can see below, Tesla’s margin dropped by 3.9 percentage points over the last five years. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle as it pursues new AI technologies such as a robotaxi or humanoid robot fleet. Tesla’s free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 6%.
3. New Investments Fail to Bear Fruit as ROIC Declines
A company’s ROIC, or return on invested capital, shows how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).
We like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company’s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. While Tesla’s ROIC fell recently due to its price cuts, the broader trend is still healthy as its ROIC is higher than a few years ago. This is because it’s investing aggressively to capture the AI opportunity. Only time will tell if these investments bear fruit in higher long-term ROICs."

The legendary investor was a rock star at Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford for more than 40 years. He was in charge of the premier Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust for over two decades, generating returns of more than 1,700% during his term.
Anderson secured his legacy early on, recognizing the dramatic growth potential of then early stage companies, including Netflix, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), delivering considerable profits for investors along the way. Given his track record, when Anderson talks, investors should listen.
Most experts agree that the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is still in its early stages, and if the trend continues, Nvidia's market cap could surge to as much as $50 trillion by 2035, according to Anderson. While that might seem improbable on its face, Anderson's reasoning is worth a look.
Dominating the space
The dawn of generative AI in early 2023 created a windfall for Nvidia. The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that quickly became the gold standard for AI. Nvidia rode the unprecedented demand for its chips to become the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.58 trillion (as of this writing).
After two successive years of triple-digit year-over-year sales growth, Nvidia's results have begun to moderate but are still enviable by any standard. In its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 27), Nvidia generated revenue that grew 56% year over year to a record $46.7 billion, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 jumped 61%.
Yet this could be just the beginning. The AI market is projected to be worth as much as $15.7 trillion by 2030, according to data compiled by ""Big Four"" accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The report suggests ""AI is still at a very early stage."" If Nvidia earns just a small slice of that total opportunity, sales and profits could continue to surge, resulting in a windfall for the chipmaker and its shareholders.
Anderson estimates the data center market, where most AI processing is conducted, is poised to grow 60% annually. If Nvidia's profit margin holds steady and the adoption of AI continues at its current pace over the next 10 years, Anderson estimates that Nvidia would deliver EPS of $1,350 and free cash flow of $1,000 per share. That would drive the stock price to about $20,000, pushing its market cap to roughly $49 trillion.
Despite increasing competition, Nvidia currently dominates the data center GPU space, commanding 92% of the market, according to IoT Analytics. Anderson points out that the company's ""persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.""
The fine print
Make no mistake, plenty of things will have to go right for Nvidia to reach this astonishing benchmark, and there will be a lot of obstacles along the way. Demand for AI could falter, a rival chipmaker could ""invent a better mousetrap,"" so to speak, or the economy could go south -- and these are just a few examples of the challenges that could arise.
Even Anderson admits that this ""isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact."" When asked about the potential for the stock to reach these meteoric heights, Anderson puts the odds at between 10% and 15%.
However, investors shouldn't miss the forest for the trees. ""It is the long duration of the development of [GPU] usage in AI -- and not just AI -- from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,"" Anderson said.
There's also the matter of Nvidia's valuation. The stock has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 54, compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. However, at less than 30 times next year's expected earnings, I'd submit it's an attractive price to pay, particularly given the magnitude of the opportunity.
Even if Nvidia doesn't hit a $50 trillion market cap over the next 10 years, all the available evidence suggests Anderson's thesis is directionally accurate. Furthermore, CEO Jensen Huang has proven particularly adept at identifying opportunities before they materialize and positioning Nvidia for future success. Given his track record, I wouldn't bet against him.
That's why I believe Nvidia stock is still a buy."

The automobile not only boosted the company's ascent, but the entire EV market as well.
The Model S showed what was possible with an electric car. From the ability to travel long distances to a self-driving mode, the vehicle broke the mold in terms of the public's perception of an EV. I thought it was a game-changer at the time, and that's why I bought the car, as well as Tesla stock.
Now, the company is racing to repeat its Model S success. This time, it's a different type of auto, as in the automated kind. And while artificial intelligence is part of the equation, the next groundbreaking achievement isn't just about AI. It's what the company calls ""sustainable abundance.""
What Tesla means by ""sustainable abundance""
Tesla periodically publishes a master plan describing long-term goals. In the latest version, the company outlined its future vision, stating, ""This next chapter in Tesla's story will help create a world we've only just begun to imagine and will do so at a scale that we have yet to see.""
Tesla predicts a future where technology is used sustainably to create boundless prosperity for all, a concept it describes as ""sustainable abundance."" The idyllic aspiration may sound appealing, but how can it be achieved in practical terms?
As a step toward its ambition, the company stated, ""We are building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world."" One example is its robotaxi service, which Tesla launched in June as a pilot program in Austin.
This program uses a modified version of its Model Y vehicles to start. Over the long run, Tesla intends to construct an AI-driven car with no steering wheel called the Cybercab.
The company plans to produce a fleet of Cybercabs in 2026 using its innovative ""unboxed"" manufacturing strategy. This vehicle construction technique employs several modular assembly lines rather than being constrained to a single, linear process.
How Tesla is pulling together its long-term vision
Self-driving cars are only the beginning. Tesla is building humanoid robots controlled by AI. The idea is that these robots will provide labor for dangerous or monotonous work, freeing up time for people to pursue more enjoyable endeavors.
Another piece of the company's vision is the sustainable aspect. For this, Tesla looks to its solar energy business. This segment saw a stupendous 67% year-over-year sales growth in 2024, contributing $10.1 billion of the company's $97.7 billion. However, through the first half of 2025, revenue growth in this area has slowed, reaching $5.5 billion compared to $4.6 billion last year.
Of course, Tesla's far-reaching objectives will take years to accomplish, and 2025 was a tough one for several reasons. Business performance was hindered by macroeconomic factors, which include tariffs combined with a drop in Tesla's popularity due to the actions of its divisive CEO, Elon Musk.
That said, the company managed to achieve a record number of vehicle deliveries and energy storage product deployments in the third quarter, although that's likely due to consumers rushing to take advantage of federal EV tax credits before they expired in September. Full business performance details will be unveiled on Oct. 22, when it's scheduled to release its Q3 earnings report.
Is now the time to buy Tesla stock?
Tesla's Model S launch demonstrated its ability to deliver technological innovation and execute on goals others thought unattainable. Its ""sustainable abundance"" plan is even more ambitious, but perhaps it can repeat the Model S feat.
The company's vision of a futuristic world with AI, autonomous vehicles, and humanoid robots has the potential to fundamentally change society. But Tesla must advance its robotaxi service as an initial step on this path.
If that proves successful, Tesla stock could skyrocket. In fact, shares are up around 80% over the past 12 months through Oct. 8. Yet as a result, its share price valuation has soared.
This chart looks at Tesla stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which indicates the amount investors are prepared to pay for each dollar of earnings over the trailing 12 months, revealing it's higher in October than it's been over the past year.
With a P/E multiple of around 250, Tesla stock is quite expensive. The sky-high valuation creates risk when investing in shares right now.
If you believe in Tesla's vision and that the company can achieve success with its robotaxi service and robots out of a sci-fi movie, then the prudent approach is to wait for the share price to drop before deciding to invest."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-12T15:10:00,"Finally, Good News for Tesla Investors -- or Is It?","After a year filled with negative headlines, consumer backlash, and declining global sales, Tesla has some good news -- or does it?",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0f333996519e98a28d1c01fe685521a68fb7e11e6370ca50033dcf2f6fecad65,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/finally-good-news-for-tesla-investors-or-is-it/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/finally-good-news-for-tesla-investors-or-is-it/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/finally-good-news-for-tesla-investors-or-is-it/,fool.com,200,,"Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) investors have waited years for a lower-cost model. Its CEO, Elon Musk, has referenced a $35,000 price point as crucial to success as long ago as 2013, and originally the Model 3 was sold for a little under $50,000 back in 2017. Tesla did introduce a rear-wheel drive Model 3 with a reduced range in 2019 for about $35,000, but eventually discontinued that version.
Fast-forward to today, and Tesla is launching not one, but two more affordable versions, one each of the Model Y crossover and Model 3 sedan with prices below $40,000 before shipping. That sounds like great news for investors, but let's dig into the details first.
Devil in the details
Tesla has named the base Model Y the Standard Rear-Wheel Drive, which starts at $39,990 before shipping and is about $5,000 less than the previous base trim, which is now referred to as the Premium Rear-Wheel Drive.
The new Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at a slightly lesser $36,990 before shipping, which is about $5,500 less than the previous base model, which is also renamed to Premium Rear-Wheel Drive.
Despite the lowered price tags, there are a few remaining questions that are a little more complicated to sort, including what consumers give up to attain the more affordable price tag. Tesla was stuck between a rock and a hard place in how to achieve its more affordable models because it was limited in how many features and how much range it could take away while maintaining its premium brand image.
While investors had hoped for a vehicle closer to $30,000 to really take an honest shot at strengthening demand, the current standard price points are more realistic. To save costs, Tesla used a battery pack that is about 10% smaller, but still boasts a driving range over 300 miles, which is a key mark and selling point for electric vehicle (EV) buyers. More specifically, Tesla's standard Model Y and Model 3 have roughly 321 miles of range compared to the premium's 357 and 363 miles, respectively.
Other features removed for the standard models include ventilated seats, rear heated seats, and feature fabric inserts instead of imitation leather. The Model 3 also retains the panoramic glass roof, while the cheaper Model Y has fabric covering the interior of the roof panel with the outside remaining glass. Tesla also removed the rear touchscreen from the standard models, and introduced a standard audio system to replace the premium version. There are also a handful of smaller changes, including manual-fold mirrors instead of powered, regular glass compared to acoustic glass, and manually adjustable steering wheels compared to powered.
So, what's the problem?
At first glance, this seems like a win for investors. However, it's unclear how consumers will see the value proposition, and we do have at least a little precedent with Tesla's previous adventure with the more affordable Cybertruck. The more affordable Cybertruck hit the roads in April for a sticker price roughly $10,000 less than the all-wheel drive version, but with the caveat that it removed about $20,000 worth of features. By September, however, that version of the Cybertruck was already discontinued, having lasted about six months.
Another factor working against the more affordable Model Y and Model 3 is that Tesla doesn't currently offer a lease option for the new models -- which isn't unusual for a new variant or model. Further, according to Electrek, the financing offered for the new Model Y standard is at an APR nearly 30% higher than the cheapest premium version.
Investors also have to consider that even if the new standard models are a success with sales volume, they're likely only cannibalizing the company's more premium options, which would depress margins in the near term.
Is it even good news?
The jury remains out on whether or not this was actually a good move for Tesla investors, but it does at least open the door to a consumer dead set on getting into a Tesla as cheaply as possible. However, it does seem like a real possibility that going this route, rather than a true new model on a new platform with the lower price tag, might not generate the expected sales jolt or demand that investors hoped for.
That said, at this point with the headwinds the company faces globally, and amid its current sales struggle, it's at least worth trying the more affordable model strategy launched this week. At the end of the day, Tesla investors would be wise to temper their expectations for the more affordable models; the value proposition just might not be enough."

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?
I get it.
Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?
Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?
Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.
But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.
First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.
Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground — which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue —power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.
Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.
I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.
Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions by cash on hand — not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.
""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week (video above). ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""
AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded."""
finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-12T12:16:00,"1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla in the $1 Trillion Club","The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to strong growth for Oracle's business, and more could be on the way.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5aadf94b82e439ed478948fb7d97d96decdde4f675c285107a8f6f14c70f72c2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-apple-m/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-apple-m/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-apple-m/,fool.com,200,,"There are several stocks that are now worth at least $1 trillion. This includes Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, which are together known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" There are others now part of the trillion-dollar club, but these are among the more notable names.
The list may get even bigger in the years ahead, as many businesses are growing and benefiting from feverish spending on artificial intelligence (AI). There's one unstoppable company that's doing well due to that trend, and which looks set to join the club in the near future: Oracle (ORCL 1.45%). Here's why it may not be too late to invest in this promising tech stock.
Oracle has become a key player in the AI boom
For years, Oracle has been known as a big name in databases and providing companies with the critical backend services and infrastructure they need to manage all their data. It still serves that purpose today, plus it also offers key products and services, which help its customers manage AI workloads.
Its new Oracle AI World, for instance, will allow its customers to use large language models to analyze existing databases. The big advantage with Oracle is that unlike many big tech companies, it's agnostic to the whole chatbot market; it isn't developing one of its own, and it's there to simply provide customers with the AI-powered products and services they need. It also has AI agents that can help to automate tasks and add efficiency.
And its efforts have been paying off. Last month, the company reported its latest quarterly results (for the period ending Aug. 31) and demand remains robust, with CEO Safra Catz noting that it ""signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1."" It expects even more large contracts to be signed in the future. And its contract backlog has skyrocketed by 359% year over year, totaling $455 billion.
Oracle's quarterly revenue totaled $14.9 billion and rose 12% year over year. Its cloud segment led the way, as sales in that business unit came in at $7.2 billion and were up by 28%.
The company also generates terrific profit margins, as its net income during the period was $2.9 billion, which is comparable to what it generated in the prior-year period. The bottom line would have been larger, however, if not for an increase in restructuring expenses, as the company has been reducing its workforce in an effort to improve efficiency.
Why a $1 trillion valuation may be just an inevitability at this point
Oracle's market cap as of the end of Monday was around $820 billion. For it to hit a $1 trillion valuation, it would need to rise by another 22% from that. In just the past year, its shares have soared more than 70%. And with tech companies continuing to invest heavily into AI, Oracle looks poised to benefit from those growth opportunities.
It may not happen soon, and it could take a couple of years, as the stock has already risen so fast. It's currently trading around its all-time highs, and its price-to-earnings multiple of 66 doesn't look cheap at all. As a result, growth investors may be thinking twice about the stock, and that could lead to limited gains, at least in the short term.
But with so much growth still out there, it may truly be an inevitability before Oracle reaches $1 trillion. According to analysts from the MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud AI market is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.4% until 2029. It's a staggering level of growth, with Oracle right in the middle of it all.
Oracle's still a good buy today
Although you may be tempted to pass on Oracle's stock because its valuation is a bit rich, over the long term, there's still much more runway for it to become more valuable. The important role it plays in tech makes it a solid investment, particularly due to its close relationship with other tech giants.
Oracle's solid fundamentals and AI-powered growth makes it a great investment to add to your portfolio today, especially if you're looking for an AI stock that still has a lot of upside left."

Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as the Trump Administration's tariffs, the divisive actions of CEO Elon Musk, and critically, falling quarterly sales, hit the automaker, hurting business performance.
But Tesla appears to be bouncing back. On Oct. 2, the company reported a record-breaking number of vehicle deliveries in the third quarter. Given this exciting news, Tesla stock may be worth picking up before the company's Q3 earnings report is released on Oct. 22.
However, some key considerations suggest it's best to wait. Here's a deeper dive into whether now is the time to buy.
Deciding on Tesla stock ahead of its Q3 earnings release
Tesla's challenging 2025 led to Q2 sales of $22.5 billion, a 12% year-over-year drop from 2024. This was due primarily to a decline in vehicle sales, with Q2 total deliveries falling 13% year over year to about 384,000.
After that disappointing outcome, Q3 deliveries came in at over 497,000. The record-setting performance handily beat Wall Street expectations.
But the car sales boost could simply be due to consumers taking advantage of a beefy $7,500 federal tax credit before it disappears at the end of 2025. If so, demand could plummet in 2026.
Another factor to consider is Tesla's share price valuation. Here's a look at the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.
The chart shows Tesla's P/E multiple in October is higher than it's been all year. This suggests the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer's stock is quite pricey right now.
That said, shares could surge in Q4 as consumers rush to take advantage of expiring tax credits. Beyond that, the EV environment appears fuzzy with no clear visibility on the overall industry's growth prospects.
The combination of an elevated valuation and a potential sales plunge next year makes now a risky time to buy Tesla stock."

Now, It's Poised to Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla in the $1 Trillion Club by 2026.",This historically low-tech business is getting a digital upgrade.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=76357a8e5e89635b420ba7446e2eb158958b1ef3d1c7479f6a5d54dec2680474,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meet-the-stock-split-stock-that-soared-by-470-over/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meet-the-stock-split-stock-that-soared-by-470-over/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meet-the-stock-split-stock-that-soared-by-470-over/,fool.com,200,,"In 2018, tech giant Apple became the first U.S. company to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Since then, it's been joined by other companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Of course, the list also includes the current market-cap leader, Nvidia.
It's becoming increasingly normal for a new company to join the $1 trillion club. But it remains an impressive feat nevertheless. At this pace, these tech titans could be joined by brick-and-mortar giant Walmart (WMT 1.71%) in 2026.
Over the past 15 years, Walmart stock has risen by 470%. The company has also been a steady dividend payer over this time. For investors who bought, held, and reinvested the dividends along the way, returns were even better with a 680% gain.
Stocks that post strong long-term gains, as Walmart stock has, often decide to undergo stock splits, bringing the price per share down due to a higher number of shares overall. Walmart has done this many times in its history, including a 3-for-1 stock split in 2024.
As of this writing, Walmart has a market cap of $820 billion. Therefore, to reach $1 trillion in 2026, it would need to appreciate by about 22% in less than 15 months. Is this really possible? It's not a sure thing, but it may be easier than some investors think.
How Walmart can reach $1 trillion
At a high level, stocks tend to go up when profit potential goes up. Perhaps profit potential goes up because a business is about to reach a new scale thanks to new locations or an acquisition. Or perhaps profit potential goes up because management is about to unlock some operating leverage. But either way, for Walmart stock to go up another 22%, one would expect improvement to its operating income over the next year or so.
Walmart is known for selling millions of products. But retail sales aren't driving growth for the company's operating income. In the earnings call to discuss financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2026, CFO John Rainey said: ""Contributions to operating income are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of interrelated drivers, including improved e-commerce, economics, and business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees.""
Rainey attributes much of Walmart's operating income growth to e-commerce, an area of the business that's absolutely booming. In Q2, e-commerce revenue was up a strong 25% year over year globally, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of about 5%. If e-commerce continues to boom in 2026, it could drive operating income, and the stock price, higher.
Walmart's e-commerce growth provides it with another opportunity: Digital advertising. The company has troves of consumer shopping data and strong relationships with top consumer brands. With more customers transacting digitally, it gives the retailer an opportunity to generate high-margin digital advertising revenue.
Additionally, Walmart recently completed its acquisition of connected-TV company Vizio. This is another channel with which the company can leverage its data and scale to advertise to consumers, which again drives operating income growth.
For what it's worth, Walmart's Q2 advertising revenue was up 46%. Granted, some of the growth was inorganic from the recent addition of Vizio. But the company is growing this revenue stream nonetheless.
In other words, Walmart's fastest-growing revenue streams also happen to be the ones that are driving growth in operating profit. Assuming these trends continue, which I do, Walmart's profits should continue to climb in 2026, providing a boost for the stock price.
To be clear, Walmart might not grow enough over the next 15 months to warrant a $1 trillion valuation before the end of 2026. But directionally, the business appears to be headed for the trillion-dollar club. It doesn't seem to be a matter of if, but rather of when."

For many investors, the list of potential candidates might start with the ""Magnificent Seven"": Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. In my opinion, you could make a strong case for any of those stocks.
And I could see why some investors would gravitate toward Berkshire Hathaway, which is like an ETF bundled within a single stock.
But I have my sights set on a stock that has quietly delivered a 58,000% return since it began trading in 1991. The business isn't flashy, but it's indispensable. It's a cash cow in good times and bad. And the company's share-buyback program can only be described as relentless.
I'm talking about AutoZone (AZO -0.62%).
You know the jingle
AutoZone is an auto parts retailer that likely needs no introduction, because that ubiquitous jingle -- ""Get in the zone, AutoZone!"" -- is probably living rent-free in your head. But if you've never peeked under the hood of AutoZone's business, you might be surprised by how strong the engine is.
Founded in 1979, AutoZone has grown from a single store in Forrest City, Arkansas, to more than 6,600 stores in the United States. AutoZone also is expanding internationally, with 883 stores in Mexico and nearly 150 in Brazil.
For the company's fiscal year 2025, which ended Aug. 30, AutoZone reported net sales of $18.9 billion, a 4.5% increase over the previous year on a 52-week basis. U.S. same-store sales -- also known as comparable-store sales -- were up 3.2%, while international same-store sales were up 9.3%, adjusting for the negative effects of currency exchange rates.
Tariff-driven cost inflation, a stronger U.S. dollar, and AutoZone's aggressive expansion efforts have put pressure on earnings. Net income dipped 6.2% to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and diluted earnings per share fell 3.1% to $144.87.
In fact, AutoZone's fiscal 2025 Q4 results marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the company has fallen short of analysts' earnings estimates. Yet the stock is up 24% this year, as of Oct. 9, which tells me that investors are focusing on the big picture. Here's why you might consider doing the same.
A huge total addressable market
One way to assess a company's growth prospects is to look at its total addressable market. AutoZone is one of the leading retailers in the automotive aftermarket. Industry associations expect the total value of the U.S. automotive aftermarket to reach $576 billion in 2025, and globally, it's valued at $2.3 trillion. . With the number of vehicles on the road and the average age of vehicles at an all-time high, demand for replacement parts should continue to be strong.
AutoZone has been investing heavily in its sales and distribution footprint to capture more market share. In fiscal 2025, AutoZone's capital expenditures rose 27% to nearly $1.4 billion. The company opened 304 new stores -- the most since 1996 -- and two new distribution centers. Management expects fiscal 2026 capex spending to be in the same ballpark, with most of it focused on ""accelerated store growth.""
Some of those new stores are larger stores that function like mini distribution centers. ""Megahubs,"" for example, are supersized AutoZone stores carrying more than 100,000 SKUs (individual products). Megahubs have been outperforming traditional stores, and they're helping smaller stores in their area fulfill orders faster. AutoZone's ultimate goal is to have 300 megahubs.
In fiscal 2025, AutoZone generated nearly $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, so it's in a strong position to keep investing in the business. Given the sheer size of the automotive aftermarket, the payoff could be massive. But there's another reason I'm such a huge fan of this stock.
AutoZone knows how to treat shareholders
Since fiscal 1998, AutoZone has scooped up $38.5 billion worth of its own shares. Over the past 10 years, AutoZone reduced its outstanding share count by 45% -- and it's still buying more shares.
Share buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders, and they signal management's confidence in the business. By reducing the supply of shares available in the market, share buybacks can enhance earnings per share and increase demand for the remaining shares -- both of which can drive the stock price higher.
You can see the inverse relationship in this chart:
Inelastic demand
There's something else that makes AutoZone a strong candidate for this ""what-if"" hypothetical.
The automotive aftermarket benefits from a concept known as inelastic demand -- meaning consumers will make essential repairs to their vehicles regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. In fact, auto parts retailers often shine in tough times, because consumers tend to pull back on buying new vehicles. As a leader in this space, AutoZone might be the ultimate recession-resistant stock, well-positioned for growth in boom times and busts."

Don't take it from me: Goldman Sachs Research predicts that robotaxis' ride-share market alone is on the path for a 90% compound annual growth rate between 2025 and 2030, and that's merely scratching the surface. If you're looking to dip your toes into what could be a generational investing opportunity, here are three stocks to keep an eye on.
One way to play robotaxis
Mobileye Global (MBLY -0.58%) is in the business of developing and deploying Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions. With a comprehensive collection of software and hardware technologies, Mobileye can offer end-to-end products and services for automakers. Investors should look at Mobileye as a solid robotaxi investment for those who don't want to deal with the drama currently surrounding Tesla.
With the automotive industry heading toward driverless vehicles, Mobileye's technology and systems will bolster automotive safety, productivity, and vehicle utilization through solutions such as Supervision, Chauffeur, Drive, and EyeQ. Meanwhile, management has been working hard to secure new ADAS deals with large customers, while finding new opportunities with untapped clients. One driving force for the company is a growing adoption of multicamera setups due to the need for increased safety and a push toward hands-free highway driving.
Adding to Mobileye's growth is its strategic partnerships, including ZEEKR, using Mobileye as its launch partner for its ADAS, and its design wins with automakers such as Porsche and Mahindra, among other major OEMs. Just this spring, Volkswagen announced a collaboration with Mobileye to improve safety and driving comfort for some of its upcoming vehicle pipeline.
The company remains unprofitable, with full-year guidance expecting an operating loss between $436 million to $512 million. That said, Mobileye boasts roughly $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, rising free cash flow, very little debt, and should be able to navigate choppy waters as the industry slowly figures out the path to full autonomous vehicles.
The business of connectivity
Aptiv PLC (APTV 1.20%) is a technology company working to bring the next generation of active safety, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and connectivity through its decades of experience pioneering advances in the automotive industry.
While the stock has faltered from its all-time highs as electric vehicle hype died down with slower-than-anticipated adoption in the U.S. market, it's still performing well, with earnings expected to check in at $7.48 per share in 2025, up significantly from $2.61 in 2021 -- a compound annual growth rate of 30%.
But its growth prospects might improve even more, with the company's business split on the horizon for the first quarter of 2026. Aptiv plans to split into two companies: one that will focus on slower-growth electrical distribution systems (EDS), and the second on faster-growth safety and software -- the latter aimed at a more driverless vehicle focus.
It's easy to understand the rationale behind the business breakup when you consider the EDS business generated 2024 sales of $8.3 billion at earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profit margins of 9.5%, while the safety and software generated 2024 sales of $12.2 billion with EBITDA margins nearly double at 18.8%.
The new Aptiv with a focus on safety and software that enable higher levels of autonomous functions won't be limited to vehicles either, with potential applications for planes and other machines. Aptiv has already begun branching out its overall business with its communications software acquisition of Wind River in 2022.
All things autonomous
Hesai Group (HSAI -2.58%) is a global leader in lidar solutions, with its products enabling a wide range of applications including passenger and commercial vehicles ADAS, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and nonautomotive applications such as last-mile delivery robots.
Throughout the company's second quarter, Hesai secured a notable number of new design wins through 2026, with 20 models from nine leading OEMs, highlighted by a platform win for multiple 2026 models with one of its top two ADAS customers. The design wins help cement lidar as a standard feature across the specific customer's model lineups and will drive the company's order book higher in the near term.
Outside its automotive wins, the company's robotics business is also doing well, ranking No. 1 in lidar shipments in China for the first half of 2025, per Gaogong Industry Research Institute. Its robotics business is well positioned for the wave of physical artificial intelligence (AI), with lidars becoming essential for AI to perceive and sort the dynamic world we operate in, especially in driverless vehicles.
""In the first six months of 2025, total shipments have already surpassed those of full-year 2024. According to Gasgoo, we ranked first in installation volume among long-range lidar suppliers during this period,"" said Hesai cofounder and CEO Yifan ""David"" Li in a press release.
Are the stocks buys?
The number of robotaxis and driverless vehicles on the roads is set to increase in the coming years, especially as leading autonomous vehicle operators reduce costs and begin scaling the business. Right now, roughly 1,500 such vehicles operate across a handful of U.S. cities, but that figure is expected to soar to about 35,000 across the country in 2030.
Even then, driverless vehicles will represent a fraction of the rideshare market, leaving plenty of long-term growth for investors who believe these companies have injected their technologies and solutions into the industry. Mobileye, Aptiv, and Hesai are all proven companies with products poised to push the boundaries of driverless vehicles, robotaxis, and ADAS going forward, and savvy investors would be wise to keep them on a watch list."

finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-11T17:30:00,What's the End of the EV Tax Credit Mean for Tesla? Listen to Elon Musk.,A key advantage for EVs is going away.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c14680adf7b2ec4987e2d12d11b5e5e6efe50dcbb6a165a3d0bfc4885cec5d54,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/whats-the-end-of-the-ev-tax-credit-mean-for-tesla/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/whats-the-end-of-the-ev-tax-credit-mean-for-tesla/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/whats-the-end-of-the-ev-tax-credit-mean-for-tesla/,fool.com,200,,"Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) has been a great American success story, but the company has received a significant assist from the government over its history, including more than $11 billion in regulatory tax credits over its history and a crucial low-interest loan from the Department of Energy when it was just getting started.
Perhaps the best-known government handout Tesla has benefited from is the $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, which slashed prices on some of its vehicles by 20% or even more in some cases. The credit gained prominence in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act designed to encourage Americans to replace gas-powered vehicles with EVs, but it expired on Sept. 30, and the move is expected to rock the EV market.
In fact, EV sales have soared in anticipation of the end of the discount. Cox Automotive reported that third-quarter EV sales are up 21.1% from a year ago, and there were other signs of a boom before the deadline as well.
That trend is likely to help Tesla in Q3, but the EV giant also stands to be the biggest loser from the change in the law.
What's at stake for Tesla
While Tesla stock has surged in recent months, approaching its all-time high, the EV business is clearly struggling. Vehicle unit sales were down last year and have continued to decline, and automotive revenue fell by 16% in Q2 to $16.6 billion, driving an overall revenue decline of 12% to $22.5 billion.
For Q3, revenue is expected to be flat, which could reflect the pull-forward effect from expiring credits.
EVs don't just compete against other EVs. While some car buyers may be specifically looking for an EV, others are price sensitive and are going to buy the vehicle that gives them the most value. Research firm Rhodium Group predicted that the change in the law would cut EV sales by 16% to 38% versus where they would have been.
While Tesla CEO Elon Musk has waffled on the impact of the end of the EV tax credit, at one point saying it would offer his company a competitive advantage because Tesla needs it less than other EV makers, he has acknowledged the affordability pressure the company faces.
In Tesla's Q3 2023 earnings call, Musk shared a familiar complaint on elevated interest rates, saying:
I am worried about the high-interest rate environment that we're in. I just can't emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment... If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people to buy the car.
Interest rates have remained elevated since then, though the Fed forecast two more cuts this year, and Tesla's sales have suffered. However, the impact of the loss of the $7,500 tax credit is going to be even bigger than a couple of percentage points in interest rates.
More recently, Musk seems to have reversed his earlier position that Tesla would benefit from the removal of the EV tax credit, as he has taken to protesting it.
Musk now seems to be recognizing the bill for what it is: a law that advantages the oil and gas industry and ICE vehicles over Tesla and EVs.
In addition to the loss of the EV tax credit, Tesla is also losing out from the removal of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) compliance credit, which was eliminated by the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" That credit required automakers that didn't meet fuel efficiency standards to buy credits from automakers like Tesla, and it had become a significant revenue stream for the company, contributing $2.67 billion in revenue in 2024. Without them, Tesla's profits could take a significant hit.
Is Tesla a buy?
Tesla's stock has surged in the last month, even though there's been little fundamental news out on the company. Instead, Musk's own enthusiasm and hype, including a purchase of $1 billion of Tesla stock, seem to have sent the stock higher. He also predicted that the Optimus autonomous robot would one day represent 80% of the company's value.
However, even if Q3 deliveries surprise to the upside, Tesla still looks overvalued at this point, especially given the loss of the EV subsidy and the broader headwinds on electric vehicles. Investors are better off waiting for a more attractive entry point or clearer signs that Tesla is returning to sustainable growth before buying the stock."

Beijing has previously used rare earths as a tool in the trade war with Washington. But with its commanding position in the battery industry, China has identified another point of leverage in trade talks as the US increasingly needs energy storage to support data centers and stabilize the grid.

The restrictions, which take effect Nov. 8, span a wide swath of the battery supply chain. They include large-scale lithium-ion batteries used for energy storage as well as cathode and anode materials and battery manufacturing machinery, all technologies where China has a robust lead.
As with past restrictions, the new rules require battery companies to receive licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce before exporting their goods. That system allows Beijing to selectively weaponize exports.
“While it doesn't impact as wide a range of industries as other Chinese export controls, the dominance of China in battery supply chains means they can squeeze hard and it can be felt pretty quickly by US companies,” said Matthew Hales, an analyst specializing in trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF.
In the first seven months of 2025, Chinese grid-scale lithium-ion batteries accounted for about 65% of US imports, according to the most recent data available from BNEF. The export curbs would affect these types of batteries, analysts said.
Battery storage is critical for the US as energy demand surges, driven by the artificial intelligence boom. US data centers more than doubled their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023, according to a report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That figure is expected to as much as triple by 2028, the report notes.
While China’s AI boom is constrained by access to advanced chips from the US, ”the energy demand piece is the constraint in the US for AI data center infrastructure,” said Emily Kilcrease, director of the Energy, Economics, and Security Program at the Center for a New American Security.
Large-scale batteries help store excess renewable energy and release it when electricity is needed. That can help avert blackouts and bolster grid stability. Practically non-existent a decade ago, US utility-scale battery installation reached a total of 26 gigawatts in 2024. In Texas alone, some 4 gigawatts of battery capacity — enough to supply power for around 3 million homes — went online last year."

But investors are currently focused on its data center business, where it sells a lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) specifically designed to power artificial intelligence (AI) development.
Nvidia has dominated the AI GPU market for the last few years, but AMD's chips are quickly catching up in terms of processing power, and some of the biggest data center operators are lining up to buy them.
In fact, on Oct. 6, AMD announced a deal with OpenAI to potentially supply the ChatGPT creator with millions of its most advanced GPUs from now through 2030. It's the biggest contract AMD has signed yet for its AI data center chips, based on publicly available information. So should investors pile into its stock right now?
Powerful new chips coming in 2026
AMD released its MI300X data center GPU in December 2023, more than a year after Nvidia launched its then-industry-leading H100, and tech giants like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms were among its early adopters.
Nvidia continues to lead the data center market with new architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, but AMD is no longer more than a year behind. The company is now shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which were built on its new Compute DNA (CDNA) 4 architecture. Those new chips' performance on inference workloads is a whopping 35 times faster than its prior-generation chips.
According to AMD, the MI355X delivers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, but it can process up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. Therefore, these chips are significantly cheaper to run, which is why data center giant Oracle is building a GPU cluster with more than 130,000 of them.
But all eyes are on AMD's MI400 lineup, which is scheduled for release in 2026. These chips will be paired with specialized software and hardware systems to create Helios, a fully integrated AI data center rack. According to CEO Lisa Su, this will make MI400 GPUs a staggering 10 times more powerful than the MI350s. Depending on what Nvidia rolls out next year, this could be the first time AMD's hardware takes the lead on performance.
OpenAI will start using MI450 GPUs in the second half of 2026, and it will continue buying future generations of AMD chips until it has deployed 6 gigawatts worth of capacity.
The OpenAI deal could supercharge AMD's data center business
AMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025. Its data center business -- led by AI GPU sales -- was the largest of its four segments, contributing $3.2 billion.
For some perspective, AMD's data center business generated just $1.3 billion in revenue in Q2 2023, when the AI boom was beginning to ramp up. But its 146% growth since then might pale in comparison to what's in the pipeline with the OpenAI deal.
According to semiconductor industry analyst Dr. Ian Cutress of the More Than Moore substack, 6 gigawatts of computing capacity could equate to between 3 million and 6 million MI450 GPUs. He estimates the value of the deal could be around $90 billion, so it could be rocket fuel for AMD's data center business.
There's a huge catch
As part of the deal, OpenAI will have the right to purchase up to 160 million AMD shares at a price of just $0.01 per share, as long as certain milestones are met by 2030:
- The shares will vest in tranches until OpenAI purchases the full 6 gigawatts of computing capacity.
- AMD shares have to meet certain price milestones, ending at $600 per share, which ensures existing shareholders benefit from some upside before they get diluted by the sale of such a large stake in the company.
But if OpenAI receives 160 million AMD shares and sells them at $600 each, it would make a whopping $96 billion. Therefore, assuming all of the terms and milestones of this deal are met, OpenAI's GPU purchases will be largely financed through the dilution of AMD's shareholders.
Of course, anyone who buys AMD stock at today's price of about $211 and holds on will accrue a 184% return if it reaches $600, so they would probably be happy with that outcome irrespective of any dilution.
These circular deals in the AI world are becoming more common because data center infrastructure is so expensive to build. Nvidia recently agreed to invest $100 billion into OpenAI at the same time that OpenAI announced it would buy 10 gigawatts of computing capacity from the chipmaker.
In summary, some of the sales growth AMD and Nvidia will report over the next few years won't necessarily be organic, which might cause some investors to reconsider the valuations they are paying for these stocks.
Nevertheless, the OpenAI deal is huge for AMD, and the terms do offer some protections for shareholders. Therefore, AMD stock is probably a good buy right now for investors who are willing to hold it for the long term."

“It’ll be a lot, and we’ll announce the numbers over the next couple of days, but it’ll be a lot of people,” Trump told reporters Friday in the Oval Office.
The administration plans to slash at least 4,100 workers from the government during the shutdown, according to newly filed court documents. Trump said that many of the affected employees worked for programs that were “Democrat-oriented” or were “people that the Democrats wanted,” without providing additional detail.
The firings mark the first large-scale ouster of federal employees during a funding lapse in modern history, going beyond the furloughs that have characterized past temporary shutdowns. More cuts are under consideration, the government said in the filing. The move ups the stakes in a multi-week standoff with Democrats over federal funding and health-care subsidies.
Labor unions representing hundreds of thousands of federal workers asked a judge Friday to immediately halt the mass firings. The emergency request to a federal judge in San Francisco seeks to bar the Office of Management and Budget from ordering officials to carry out the firings and block agencies from issuing reduction-in-force notices before the judge holds a hearing next week.
The judge didn’t immediately rule but did move up the hearing by a day to Oct. 15.
White House Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the cuts with a terse social media post on Friday.
Spokespeople for HHS, DHS, the Department of Education and the Department of Housing and Urban Development confirmed workers at those agencies are among those affected by the firings. Commerce Department workers were also terminated, according to a US official.
At the Internal Revenue Service, which sits within the Treasury Department, the administration plans to fire about 1,300 workers, people familiar with the situation said Friday. All staffers in Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund were laid off, according to people familiar with the matter.
And the Environmental Protection Agency notified approximately 20 to 30 employees that they may be affected by cuts in the future, though a final decision has not been made, according to the filing.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune sought to lay blame for the layoffs at Democrats’ feet.
“To their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Thune said Friday before the layoffs were announced.
In the days before the announcement, some congressional Republicans urged the White House to hold off, saying it dilutes their message that it’s Republicans who are standing up for federal workers.
Susan Collins of Maine, the leader of the Senate’s appropriations panel, became the first Republican to publicly oppose Vought’s moves while still pinning the blame for the shutdown on Democrats.
“Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country,” Collins said in a statement.
Democrats argue that spending money to conduct layoffs in a shutdown is illegal.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sought to cast the firings as an affront against US workers that sows “deliberate chaos.”
“Let’s be blunt: nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Schumer said in a Friday statement. “They don’t have to do it; they want to.”
More than two-thirds of civilian federal employees have remained on the job this shutdown — either as essential workers or in roles that receive longer-term funding — with the rest being sent home. The vast majority of federal employees go without pay.
Federal Downsizing
The latest move is reminiscent of Elon Musk’s efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year to slash the federal workforce. The Tesla Inc. chief executive officer gutted the federal workforce through voluntary resignations, retirements, and targeted firings of probationary employees.
About 150,000 of the voluntary departures took effect with the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, but some other staffing reductions have been tied up by court challenges.
Friday’s job eliminations mark the latest effort by Trump to make the shutdown as painful as possible for Democratic constituencies while deeming his own priorities as essential services.
Hours into the shutdown earlier this month, the Trump administration paused $18 billion in infrastructure spending in New York City, $2 billion for Chicago transit and $8 billion for green energy projects in 16 states — all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.
The White House has previously admitted that the DOGE job cuts presented political risks. Trump has mused that Musk’s efforts weren’t politically popular and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said DOGE got its attempt to cut federal spending “backward” by leading with mass terminations, rather than looking to create efficiencies.
The tactic gives Trump a chance to talk tough to his MAGA base. He has often derided the federal workforce as being stacked with bureaucrats who he says oppose his agenda. But it also leaves less room for Republicans to blame the most enduring consequences of a shutdown on Democrats.
On Capitol Hill, bipartisan talks have continued in fits and starts, with a handful of Democrats crossing party lines to support short-term spending bills. But party leaders remain divided over whether to tie an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies to reopening the government.
Democrats warned that Vought’s actions will make an agreement to end the shutdown even more difficult as they further erode trust. Reversing the cuts and layoffs will themselves become Democratic demands as part of any deal to stop the shutdown.

It disrupted the market by bringing mass appeal to electric vehicles (EVs). And its success has resulted in a valuation of around $1.3 trillion.
Shareholders have captured huge returns along the way. If you invested $5,000 in this top EV stock five years ago, here's how much you'd have today.
Tesla shares have accelerated gains for investors
Tesla has been a monster winner. The stock has surged 186% higher in the past five years (as of Oct. 10), turning that $5,000 starting sum into $14,290 today. While the result is magnificent, it hasn't been a smooth ride. Tesla shares tend to be extremely volatile. They were down almost 50% at one point just this year, before recovering over the past six months.
Musk's grand vision continues to drive the narrative
Any reasonable analysis of the stock will surely conclude that the valuation isn't based on reality. Shares trade at a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of 250. The market continues to focus less on weak EV demand and profitability.
Instead, investors keep buying into founder and CEO Elon Musk's grand vision. The belief is that at some point in the not-too-distant future, the company will collect robust profits from robotaxis and humanoid robots, which makes the current valuation not matter much. Time will tell."

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is once again looking into Tesla (TSLA, Financials) because of its Full Self-Driving technology. The investigation includes about 2.88 million cars and comes after a number of reports of safety infractions, such as drivers running red lights or changing lanes the wrong way.
Since the Full Self-Driving (FSD) system came out in 2016, Tesla's major goal has been to make self-driving cars viable with software and sensors. But it has also generated a lot of trouble. Regulators have raised concerns about its dependability, and drivers have reported incidents and near misses that were caused by its performance.
The NHTSA stated it had gotten 58 reports on Tesla's FSD software, 14 of which were crashes and 23 of which were injuries. Tesla just released a software upgrade, but the company has not said anything about the latest probe.
The most recent investigation is just one more problem Tesla has with the law. Last month, U.S. lawmakers called for an official investigation into FSD after hearing that the program didn't see trains arriving at crossings. The government also started a preliminary investigation of the Model Y door handles after reports that kids were getting stuck inside for a short time.
The new inquiry adds to the regulatory uncertainties for investors at a time when Tesla is trying to move on to its next growth phase with robotaxis and advanced self-driving technologies. The company's stock has gone up more than 70% in the last six months, but it might be volatile in the short term as regulators look at any safety issues."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) saw a small but welcome rebound in China last month. After two straight months of declines, the company's local deliveries rose 2.8% from a year earlier to 90,812 vehicles, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
The increase came as Tesla rolled out its six-seat Model Y SUV, which has caught on with family buyers, and started shipping China-made cars to India for the first time.
The uptick helped lift third-quarter deliveries to nearly 242,000 vehicles among the highest the Shanghai plant has recorded.
To keep the momentum, Tesla is offering 0% financing, paint credits, and Full Self-Driving transfers in China, while cheaper Model 3 and Model Y versions debut in the U.S. later this year."

A look at Wall Street amid Trump tariff talks on China
The stock market plunged Oct. 10 after President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on China in response to new restrictions on natural resources.
The Nasdaq Composite was down as much as 2.6% early in the afternoon, according to CNBC, while the S&P 500 fell 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3%. Those numbers had rebounded slightly but returned to approximately the same levels as of 2 p.m.
Among other popular stocks Vanguard was down 1.73%, Nividia 2.43%, Amazon 3.64%, Tesla 3.85%, Apple 2.6% and Invesco QQQ 2.28%.
The shift was apparently the result of a Truth Social post by Trump in which he alleged that China was ""becoming very hostile"" in restricting rare earth metals, which are key components in producing a variety of technological items.
""Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,"" Trump wrote. ""I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time.""
Trump noted that he was scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks, but now ""there seems to be no reason to do so."" The administration is considering a ""massive increase"" on tariffs among other countermeasures, he said.
""I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,"" Trump wrote. ""Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.""
The stocks had been considerably higher before Trump's post. According to CNBC, the Nasdaq reached a new all-time high within the day prior to the president's comments."

Third quarter earning season is underway with the biggest tech names slated to report later in the month. It'll of course give us the latest read on just how much companies are spending and making on artificial intelligence, which has driven markets to repeated record highs. Here with more on what to watch is Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and Global Head of Technology Research. Dan, it's great to see you, as always. Um, so we're going into earning season for this company for these companies at a time where there is this debate of valuations. There is this debate about the so-called circular economy, how much they're all sort of spending on each other. Um, what are you going to zero in on in the in these earnings reports?
Yeah, I look, Julia, I'd say, I mean, the street's still massively underestimating what this tech cycle is going to look like. I think it's an AI super cycle. And I think this 3Q earnings is going to be much more of a validation moment in terms of not just for chips but for software. And I think the broader build out. Look, it continue the bears in hibernation mode. They've missed the last two and a half years. and they'll continue to miss this bull market that I think has another two years ahead of it.
You know, it's interesting because I haven't talked to that many bears, right? The bears, the straight up bears are hard to find on this stuff. It's more the message that maybe you should start to diversify a little bit. It's not that you should sell necessarily, maybe take a little bit of profits and put it in some of the smaller companies in the space, put them outside of AI entirely because maybe we're in a little bit of a a breathing period here. What do you think of that argument, Dan?
Look, I get it. I mean, but my view is we're in the second inning of a nine- inning cycle. So, I mean, to to peel away from an AI perspective, talk about people have peeled away from AMD over the last, you know, a month ago, or Oracle six months ago, or Nvidia a year ago. See my whole point is like, the street's under estimating what this cycle is going to look like. And I think ultimately in the next one, two years, numbers are maybe 20, 30% underestimated. And I think that's why three Q earnings is just going to be more validation showing the use cases are exploded."

As competition intensifies and price wars deepen, Tesla is hoping that its new variant— the Model Y+ — can ignite buyer interest and help it regain lost ground.
Tesla’s China Sales Struggle Amid Fierce Competition
Per CnEVPost, Tesla China sold 515,552 vehicles (including exports) from January to August, reflecting a 12.2% decline year over year. Still, there were signs of a rebound in August. During the month, Tesla’s local sales rose 41% month over month to 57,152 units, per the China Passenger Car Association, as cited by Teslarati. Its Giga Shanghai plant produced over 83,000 vehicles, making it the company’s strongest wholesale month so far this year.
Much of Tesla’s growth in China this year has come from one vehicle — the Model Y. The compact SUV has been a hit with Chinese consumers, accounting for roughly 70% of Tesla’s local sales, and even ranking as the second-best-selling vehicle in China overall. Tesla China's August deliveries are also likely to have gotten a boost from the launch of the Model Y L, a long-wheelbase six-seater variant, to attract family-oriented buyers.
Nonetheless, even with the new variants and periodic discounts, Tesla’s deliveries in China remain under pressure amid competition and pricing war.
Model Y+: A Bid to Regain Traction
Tesla has now filed for approval of a new Model Y+ variant in China, according to a recent listing in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology’s (MIIT) catalog. The new model is meant to help Tesla compete better in a market where buyers now care most about range and efficiency.
The Model Y+ will feature a 225 kW (302 hp) single-motor setup and use ternary batteries from LG Energy Solution, similar to the Model 3+ introduced earlier this year. Early filings suggest it could deliver around 800 kilometers (nearly 500 miles) of CLTC range, making it the longest-range Model Y in Tesla’s China lineup.
The Model Y+ is Tesla’s next big bet to stay relevant in China’s competitive EV landscape. This longer-range variant could inject fresh energy into Tesla’s offerings—but whether it’s enough to close the gap with local champions remains the big question.
Tesla’s China Rivals Log Strong Sales Gains
BYD Co Ltd BYDDY has taken the lead in terms of volume, while XPeng Inc. XPEV and NIO Inc. NIO are also drawing buyers rapidly.
In the third quarter of 2025, BYD delivered 582,500 pure EVs, up 31% year over year, maintaining its lead over Tesla for the fourth straight quarter. Tesla’s own global deliveries hit 497,099 units in the third quarter, up 7.4% year over year, but still behind BYD’s total."

On air, Dave Ramsey and his co‑host, John Delony, unpacked the emotional letter. Ramsey didn't hesitate.
""Legally, it's your money, period. No court's even going to look at this. They'd dismiss it in 30 seconds,"" he said. ""But if you truly believe it was a mistake — like an envelope mailed to the wrong address — then, morally, you give it to them.""
Ramsey walked through two possibilities. If the parents simply forgot to update their paperwork when the kids became adults, then the aunt could hand over the funds knowing she'd done the right thing. But if the couple intentionally named her — maybe because they trusted her more than their children — that's a different story. ""They're not entitled to it just because they're kin,"" he said. ""If Mom and Dad's intent was clear, you don't owe them anything.""

That's when Delony offered what he called Option 3. ""Maybe these kids are hurting,"" he said. ""They've been through a lot. Maybe their parents knew there'd be immaturity and wanted their aunt to make wise choices with this money — to love them through it.""
Ramsey nodded, suggesting that if the parents had wanted their sister to act as a caretaker of the funds, she could ""dole it out slowly, like a trust."" College tuition? Sure. Rent for an apartment? Maybe not. ""You decide what your sister and brother‑in‑law would've done,"" he told her.
Delony circled back a few minutes later, putting the dilemma in personal terms: What if it were his own family? ""If I had a niece and nephew — one doing great, one struggling — I might say, ‘Yes for tuition, but no for your next life mistake. I'll take care of you like your parents would have.'"" Ramsey agreed: ""That's loving your family well, even if they don't like it."""

“Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary suggests that you should not invest more than 5% of your portfolio in Bitcoin and more than 20% in the entire cryptocurrency sector.
“Don’t put the farm onto any one stock,” O’Leary said during a Wired Q&A released on Oct. 3. “In other words, don’t bet everything ever. My diversification strategy was taught to me by my mother. Never more than 20% in anyone’s sector, including crypto. Never more than 5% in any one’s stock or bond.”

O’Leary’s remarks came in response to a question from a viewer about the rationale for investing in Bitcoin. He said people did not have to invest in the leading digital asset. Still, he explained that he was an investor because he believed in the asset and digital payments.
“I do invest in Bitcoin ’cause I’m a believer in crypto and a believer in digital payment systems over time,” he said. “We have 11 sectors in the S&P, including real estate, which was recently added; it’s the most recent. Crypto is not yet a sector, but I believe it’ll become the 12th.”
Meanwhile, O’Leary’s cryptocurrency investment strategy also includes infrastructure plays. In May, he told CoinDesk that he held Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock.
“No matter what crypto is doing, up or down, the exchange is making money because it’s the infrastructure,” he said at the time.

O’Leary also said that he preferred stablecoins for yields over bank deposits. All of these, however, fall within his 20% allocation for the cryptocurrency sector. At the time, he told CoinDesk that he had 19% exposure to cryptocurrencies, just below the threshold.
Meanwhile, O’Leary last month urged investors seeking direct cryptocurrency exposure to stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum, warning against “irrelevant” tokens.

“We estimate TSLA could capture 5% of our projected ~$9T humanoid robot market by 2050,” RBC analysts wrote.
Following an investor tour of Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory, RBC said the company “aims to integrate Optimus across three key verticals: manufacturing, hospitality, and consumer.”
Management reportedly emphasized that Optimus would not be involved in military or police applications and highlighted “its unified platform and ability to leverage FSD as core competitive advantages.”
RBC believes humanoid robots represent a vast market opportunity, estimating an approximately $9 trillion global TAM by 2050, with “households (33%), agriculture (21%), manufacturing & logistics (12%), and retail and commerce (11%)” as the largest areas for adoption.
China is said to represent 61% of the TAM, followed by the RoW at 24%, the EU at 8%, and the US at 7%.
For Tesla specifically, RBC assumes Optimus will focus on the consumer (household), manufacturing and logistics, and hospitality segments, leading to a Tesla-specific TAM of “$4.3T, representing nearly half of the original TAM.”
The note stated that of Tesla’s humanoid revenue, “22% is from the US, 14% from the EU, 58% from China, and 6% from RoW.”
“Applying these assumptions, Tesla could generate $404B in humanoid-related revenue by 2050,” RBC remarked.
The humanoid segment “accounts for 36% of its total valuation,” with “Robotaxi contributing another 37%, followed by FSD at 11%, Cars at 8%, and Megapacks at 8%.”

Citigroup Inc.’s basket of 46 stocks most favored by non-professional investors, which includes companies like SoFi Technologies Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc., is up 30% since the start of September, beating the S&P 500 Index’s 4.3% gain. Meanwhile, retail trading volume has increased to an all-time-high, the bank’s equity trading desk wrote in a research note Tuesday.
“It’s been our contention for quite some time that the stock market gains have been largely propelled by a combination of FOMO and MOMO,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “At this point, every dip is perceived as a buying opportunity, and uptrends are something to be chased.”
Citigroup’s figures on trading activity defied weak October seasonality, with volume rising to the highest since the bank started tracking the data in 2018.
Data from other banks shows a big jump in volume as well. From Oct. 2 through the close of trading on Oct. 8, retail investors accelerated their weekly purchases of stocks to $7 billion, an increase from the of $5.3 billion per week over the past two months, JPMorgan equity and quant strategist Arun Jain wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
The buying spree coincided with renewed optimism around artificial intelligence stocks, fueled by a series of corporate deals, bets on interest-rate cuts and expectations for resilient earnings. Indeed, AI-linked names remain the epicenter of retail enthusiasm. Dell Technologies Inc. drew its largest inflow in nearly five months, while members of the Magnificent Seven such as Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., but excluding Apple Inc., saw sizable buying, Jain wrote.
Risk-on sentiment is present in the options market as well. Over the last seven trading sessions, retail gamma supply — a gauge of how much investors are selling options and collecting premiums on short-dated calls and puts — jumped to an all-time high of $93 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The surge was led by growth-oriented names, with technology and communications stocks seeing the steepest pickup."

About Tradr ETFs
Tradr ETFs are designed for sophisticated investors and professional traders who are looking to express high conviction investment views. The strategies include leveraged and inverse ETFs that seek short or long exposure to actively traded stocks and ETFs.
IMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION
Tradr ETFs are for sophisticated investors and professional traders with high conviction views and are very different from most other ETFs. The Funds are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles and pursue leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the Funds magnify the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Fund's return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security.
Investors in the fund should: (a) understand the risks associated with the use of leverage; (b) understand the consequences of seeking inverse and leveraged investment results; (c) for short ETFs, understand the risk of shorting; (d) intend to actively monitor and manage their investment. Fund performance will likely be significantly different than the benchmark over periods longer than the specified reset period and the performance may trend in the opposite direction than its benchmark over periods other than that period."

In many ways, we’ve said the fundamentals just don’t matter. That’s why the stock trades at a nonsensical PE multiple, 180*26 earnings. Bitcoin is really the better comp.

Tesla’s recently reported strong Q3 deliveries, as expected, amid a temporary boost due to pull-forward demand due to the end of EV tax credits. Tesla’s latest announcement of cheap models failed to impress the market. It also shows Tesla is losing pricing power amid intense competition. Cheaper models are also expected to negatively impact its auto margins. In Europe, the new budget models will face intense competition from European and Chinese brands, which are already offering several models under or near $30,000.
In 2024, Tesla's global deliveries fell for the first time, while the company is expected to see another 10% this year, Reuters reported. China’s BYD recently reported a whopping 800% increase in UK sales and the company is beating Tesla in most of Europe.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

US safety regulators launched a probe into Tesla self-driving cars, affecting around 2.9 million vehicles, after reports emerged of vehicles running through red lights, veering into wrong lanes, and crashing in some instances.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a filing that it is looking into 58 cases in which Teslas reportedly violated traffic safety laws while using the company's so-called Full Self-Driving mode or FSD.
The new investigation adds to several other open inquiries into Tesla technology that could upend Elon Musk's plans to turn millions of his cars already on the road into completely driverless vehicles with an over-the-air update to their software.
The probe comes as Musk, whose fortune as the world's richest man derives partly from Tesla's stock, has promised to roll out hundreds of thousands of driverless taxis in cities around the US by the end of next year.
Tesla has argued to regulators and in court cases that it has repeatedly told drivers the system cannot drive the cars by itself and whoever is behind the wheel must be ready to intervene at all times.
Regulators claim that many of the Tesla drivers involved in accidents said the cars gave them no warning about unexpected behaviour.
Tesla stock fell nearly 3% at one point Thursday but closed with a loss of just 0.7%.
Continued lawsuits
Earlier this year, the NHTSA launched a separate investigation into Tesla’s “summon” feature after a string of minor collisions in car parks. And in August, regulators opened yet another inquiry into why Tesla has allegedly been slow to report crashes as required.
That same month, a Miami jury found that Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver-assist technology — which is different from full self-driving — and must pay the victims more than $240 million (€207.55mn) in damages.
The self-driving technology system now under investigation is what is called Level 2 driver-assistance software that requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. A new version was introduced earlier this week.
The company is also testing a vastly upgraded version that does not require driver intervention, something that Musk has been promising to roll out for years.
Tesla is under pressure to show success with this technology because the main part of its business — selling cars — is struggling.
Customers who dislike Musk's support of President Donald Trump and far-right candidates in Europe have boycotted the company, sinking sales. Meanwhile, rival EV makers, including China's BYD, are stealing market share with cheaper, high-quality offerings.
In response, Musk on Tuesday announced Tesla would be selling two new, stripped down and cheaper versions of models already on the road, including its best-selling Model Y. But investors, hoping for lower prices or a completely new offering, were unimpressed, pushing the stock down 4.5%."

Cramer discussed Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) ahead of its EV event yesterday that saw it launch new versions of the Model 3 and Y, which were priced below $40,000. He commented on Musk’s relationship with the US government and President Trump:
“[On upcoming event] I still think it’s been underrated how much that company changed when he broke free of the President. Or when he split with the President. Now I don’t want to be political about it, but there were a lot of people who were saying, listen, we got the expiration credit and there’s a lot of people who just said, okay, he’s not, I’m not making a statement that I’m buying a Trump card. Remember the country’s split in half.

It’s incredible that so much money can gravitate toward one person, but then again, it’s hard to find someone like Elon Musk. Starting an online fintech company before it became mainstream, starting the electric vehicle (EV) trend with Tesla, launching rockets into space that land back safely and turning Twitter into X don’t even touch on his artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, such as Grok and Optimus.

It’s hard to find anyone who can match Musk’s results and intellect across multiple industries. However, hard work and smarts aren’t enough to become a trillionaire. There are more factors at play, and this guide will outline some of the things Musk did right on his path of wealth building.
Outworking the Competition
Musk is well known for his intense work schedule. He works roughly 80 to 100 hours per week, and while long hours don’t guarantee success, they could better your odds of outperforming the competition.
An 80-hour workweek comes to a little more than 11 hours per day, assuming Musk also works on the weekends. It’s also plenty of time that he can allocate toward multiple companies instead of having only one business.
Check Out: 2 of Elon Musk’s Top Money Mistakes (and What Can Be Learned From Them)
Starting Multiple Businesses Around Mega Trends
Musk has made a fortune from several businesses instead of just one company. PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX and xAI are some of the lucrative companies that he launched. Many of these businesses also came at the right times, as they were early to various megatrends.
For example, PayPal was an early company in the online payments industry, and Tesla led the EV boom and dictated competitors’ actions. Musk often gets involved in mega trends early, builds companies around them and positions himself to profit handsomely when those mega trends gain traction.
Anticipating Future Problems
Musk has started many businesses in the early stages of mega trends, and that’s because he anticipates future problems. Identifying the issues that many people will want solutions to can help him gain market share.
Musk’s ability to anticipate what products and services will be valuable in the future is part of the reason he may become the world’s first trillionaire.
Investing In His Companies
A salary alone won’t turn you into a trillionaire. Musk builds wealth by investing in his companies and benefiting as those companies gain value. The tech billionaire recently bought $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, indicating he wants more exposure to the company’s upside."

Oct. 9 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell about 2% on Thursday morning after U.S. auto safety regulators began a new investigation into nearly 3 million vehicles equipped with the company's Full Self-Driving system, according to a Thursday statement from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The agency said it is reviewing reports that some Tesla cars failed to obey red traffic lights or moved incorrectly during lane changes while the system was active. The Full Self-Driving feature is marketed as a driver-assistance tool that requires drivers to remain attentive and ready to intervene.
NHTSA said it had received six crash reports involving Tesla vehicles that entered intersections against red signals, resulting in collisions with other cars. Four of those incidents led to injuries, the regulator said.
The new inquiry marks the latest in a series of safety reviews into Tesla's driver-assistance technology. In September, NHTSA also opened a preliminary probe into Model Y door handles following reports that children were briefly trapped inside due to design issues.
Tesla has not commented on the latest investigation."

Porsche on Thursday joined BMW and Mercedes-Benz in reporting weaker sales in China, where local competitors led by BYD Co. and Xiaomi Corp. are winning over buyers with competitively priced electric vehicles. BMW earlier this week cut its earnings outlook after demand in the world’s biggest auto market fell short of expectations.
The China struggles add to US tariff costs and stagnant sales in Europe, squeezing Germany’s carmakers across their three core markets. Despite pouring billions of euros into battery technology, their first wave of EVs failed to gain traction, with next-generation models not arriving until next year.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday announced €3 billion ($3.5 billion) in new EV aid and said he’ll push back hard against European Union plans to effectively ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars in 2035. But auto executives also are decrying red tape and high energy costs in the country. They’re responding by throttling output, cutting tens of thousands of jobs and scaling back costly battery programs.
“The German manufacturing sector, and the automotive industry in particular, are in a perfect storm,” said Jens Suedekum, an economics professor and adviser to German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil. “Market shares in China are in sharp decline, the Chinese overcapacities are hurting German exports across all markets, and unlike in 2024 the US market is no longer available as a substitute.”
The slump is threatening manufacturers that for decades helped drive the success of Germany’s export-oriented economy. The country’s auto sector has lost roughly 55,000 jobs over the past two years, according to the VDA trade group. Tens of thousands of additional positions are set to disappear by 2030, in an industry that employs more than 700,000 people.
Volkswagen AG — Germany’s largest automaker that operates more than 100 factories globally — is paring back production and shedding staff. Robert Bosch GmbH, the world’s biggest auto supplier, plans to slash 18,500 jobs, most of them in Germany. Peers like Continental, Schaeffler and ZF Friedrichshafen are also cutting workers, with Ford Motor Co. reducing staff and output in Germany.
The cutbacks have sparked fears of a “Nokia moment,” a nod to the rapid decline of the once-dominant smartphone maker. The companies have complained about elevated manufacturing labor costs, which are more than twice as high in Germany as in the Czech Republic, according to Eurostat data. In the first half of 2025, combined profits at the German automakers dropped by more than a third from a year earlier, according to EY.
“The situation is serious — industrial production is falling and layoffs are increasing,” said Achim Wambach, president of the country’s ZEW economic institute. “Companies need lower energy costs, lower taxes and less bureaucracy.”
The fallout risks spreading beyond Germany’s borders. The country’s auto sector is responsible for roughly a quarter of Europe’s vehicle output and anchors a supply chain that stretches from Spain to Slovakia. Its slowdown threatens to undercut the region’s manufacturing base, weaken exports and deepen the sense that Europe is losing ground in the global race for next-generation technologies.
The German carmakers aren’t sitting idle. BMW is betting that its €10 billion Neue Klasse line of next-generation EVs can turn around sales in China, while Volkswagen has struck partnerships with local software and EV makers to return to growth in Asia’s biggest economy. The owner of the Audi and Skoda brands is doing better in Europe this year after updating its cars with new software, and is on track to sell more EVs than Tesla Inc. and Stellantis NV in the region.
Still, with production falling and investment plans on hold, business groups are warning that Germany risks losing its status as a manufacturing hub. The malaise is turning into a political liability for Merz, whose conservatives have slipped behind the far-right Alternative for Germany in some polls.
Merz has pledged to lift Germany out of stagnation with massive spending on infrastructure and defense. His coalition government on Thursday indicated it’s ready to back industry demands for more flexible EU rules on the future of gasoline cars, but hasn’t yet agreed on a specific path forward. While EVs will become the dominant technology, sticking to the 2035 cutoff for combustion-engine cars makes no sense, the chancellor said.
“If it were up to me, there would be no such abrupt change,” Merz said after meeting auto CEOs including BMW’s Oliver Zipse and Volkswagen’s Oliver Blume in Berlin.
The coalition did agree on €3 billion in additional purchase incentives for zero-emissions vehicles through 2029, a program meant to help low- and middle-income households make the switch to cleaner modes of transport. Earlier this week, it announced plans to extend a tax exemption for EVs.
But there’s little evidence so far that Berlin’s moves are making a dent. After two years of contraction, the government expects an expansion of just 0.2% this year. On Wednesday, the country’s statistics office published figures showing that German industrial production fell the most since early 2022, driven by an 18.5% drop in auto manufacturing.
“This isn’t just about factories closing,” said Benjamin Krieger, secretary general of CLEPA, an industry group representing Europe’s auto suppliers. “It’s about the industry’s social fabric, its communities and Europe’s technological sovereignty.”

Ripple Maps, Gainwize’s proprietary visualization technology, uncovers hidden supply chain winners while other investors chase headlines
Seattle, WA, Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gainwize, an investment research platform, has launched its proprietary Ripple Maps technology to help retail investors identify under-the-radar companies powering major tech trends such as AI, space exploration, robotics, and drone technology. While many investors rush into well-known names like Tesla and NVIDIA after their stock prices have soared, Ripple Maps enables users to uncover the lesser-known companies behind these giants—often before institutional capital arrives.
Curated ""Waves"" to discover the next generation of innovators in any field.
The Problem: Retail Investors Are Always Late to the Party
The pattern is familiar to any investor who came of age during the smartphone revolution, crypto boom, or AI explosion: By the time a trend hits mainstream financial media, the biggest gains are already gone. Investors who bought Bitcoin at $60,000 or NVIDIA at $400 watched in frustration as early adopters who got in years earlier made fortunes.
""Retail investors are tired of being the last money in,"" says the Gainwize team. ""Everyone knows AI is big. Everyone knows space is the future. But who's making the chips that power AI training? Who's manufacturing the components for SpaceX? Those are the companies that can deliver outsized returns.""
The Solution: Follow the Ripple, Not the Wave
Gainwize's platform centers on a unique visualization technology called Ripple Maps, which displays the ecosystem of companies connected to major trends. Instead of just seeing ""AI stocks,"" investors can explore:
-
Component manufacturers supplying AI hardware leaders
-
Software infrastructure companies enabling AI deployment
-
Energy providers powering massive data centers
-
Materials companies providing rare earth elements
The platform combines this relationship mapping with momentum scoring, insider trading data, and curated ""Waves""—think Spotify playlists, but for investment opportunities in specific sectors.
Why Now? The Perfect Storm for Hidden Opportunities
With AI spending expected to exceed $200 billion by 2026, space launch frequency tripling, and drone delivery finally becoming reality, the supply chains powering these trends are expanding rapidly. Small and mid-cap companies with critical technology or components are seeing explosive growth—but flying under the radar of most retail investors and financial media."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-09T13:39:13,Here's Why Tesla Stock Is a Buy Before Oct. 22,"The fourth quarter won't be easy for the company, but there's a lot to look forward to beyond the near-term data.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7febff920ca3fc06331439b15cfdbebf6e2463f6255fe731d2aa7d13554fc234,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/heres-why-tesla-stock-is-a-buy-before-oct-22/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/heres-why-tesla-stock-is-a-buy-before-oct-22/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/heres-why-tesla-stock-is-a-buy-before-oct-22/,fool.com,200,,"Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) investors have already gotten clues as to what to expect from the company's upcoming third-quarter results. That's because last week, management reported its electric vehicle delivery numbers for the third quarter. They were encouraging numbers, and since Tesla sells direct to customers, its delivery numbers are its sales volumes.
While the quarter's numbers beat the analyst consensus, it's not likely to be the key recent development that will drive the stock higher. Here's a look at three things that could be.
1. Tesla's third-quarter earnings and what they could mean for Q4
The third quarter earnings report is scheduled for release on Oct. 22, and it's essential to approach the results like Goldilocks planning a last-minute vacation in the woods. On the too-hot side, deliveries of 497,099 vehicles represented a 7.4% increase on last year's third quarter and a 29.4% increase on the second quarter of 2025.
However, as most investors are aware, federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles (EVs) expired on Sept. 30, and there's likely a significant pull forward in sales into the third quarter, and away from the fourth quarter. This is highly likely to lead to a significant sequential decline in Tesla deliveries in the fourth quarter.
On the too-cold side of the argument, Tesla doesn't just generate sales in the U.S., so the EV federal tax credit issue won't impact all of its sales. Based on publicly available figures, Tesla generated 62.6% of its sales by volume internationally in the second quarter.
In other words, Tesla's sales might not be that bad on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter, and Wall Street analysts are likely to ask CEO Elon Musk about the cadence of sales in the U.S. in the first few weeks of October during the earnings call -- something to watch for.
2. Tesla will update on a new, lower-cost model
With the general drift in the EV automaking world toward fewer incentives and higher pricing, particularly as interest rates remain relatively high, EV companies need to lower the prices of EVs. That's one reason why the market got excited when Tesla disclosed that it began production of a lower-cost Model Y (Tesla's best-selling model) in the first half and would ramp production slowly in the third quarter, ready for launch in the fourth quarter after the tax credit expired.
This is essential because EVs have significantly lower fuel and maintenance costs compared to internal combustion engine or hybrid cars; therefore, a reduction in the up-front cost will have a substantially greater impact on the vehicle's lifetime cost. Moreover, it could make Tesla eligible for incentives like the U.K.'s electric car grant of up to $5,000 for new vehicles priced at less than $49,600.
3. Tesla's latest version of full self-driving software
The launch of Tesla's latest supervised full self-driving (FSD) update (version 14) highlights the key to the medium-term investment case -- the potential for robotaxis and unsupervised FSD to lead to a dramatic increase in revenue and earnings in future years.
The excitement centers on the commercial potential of unsupervised robotaxis for ride-sharing revenue for Tesla, whether via its dedicated Cybercab (set for volume production in 2026) or Tesla vehicles transformed via (as-yet unreleased or approved) unsupervised FSD.
To achieve either milestone, Tesla will need to enhance its FSD offering. For that, it requires data on miles driven to improve its neural networks continually, and eliminate so-called ""edge case"" issues that involve complex driving situations.
The good news is that no other company comes even close to Tesla's data. For example, Alphabet's Waymo was reported to have driven 100 million fully autonomous miles in the summer, compared to approximately Tesla's 4.5 billion miles at the end of the second quarter.
Moreover, much of the newer data from Tesla will come from hardware 4 vehicles (faster processing power, higher camera resolution, better night clarity, and a broader field of view), which started shipping in 2023.
Why Tesla stock is a buy
The ongoing robotaxi rollout, the new FSD version confirming the strength of Tesla's data advantage, a lower-cost model, and the potential for Tesla's sales to surpass a low bar of expectations in the fourth quarter collectively make the bull case for the stock.
As ever, investors should note that there are no guarantees that fully autonomous robotaxis or publicly available unsupervised FSD will come to fruition, or even do so in a timely fashion. As such, Tesla is a speculative stock, but such stocks often warrant a small allocation in the riskier end of an investor's portfolio because the upside can be significant."

But that rally is now stalled as a pair of unusual risks has investors questioning the company’s elevated valuation.
The streaming pioneer’s stock was the fourth-best performer in the Nasdaq 100 Index in the first six months of 2025, soaring 50%, and the second half of the year seemed to get off to a good start with the June 20 release of the animated musical . The movie has been a huge hit, becoming Netflix’s most-watched original film. However, the shares are down 9% since the end of June, while the Nasdaq 100 Index is up almost 11% over the same period.
The first-half gains would be reason enough for investors to think twice about buying Netflix shares. Then President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff “on any and all movies that are made outside of the United States,” and Elon Musk urged his social-media followers to cancel their subscriptions after taking issue with comments made by the creator of a now canceled Netflix show. The developments brought a new level of uncertainty, with the stock falling for five straight days, before rebounding with a three-day rally.
The stock was little changed on Thursday.
“We can’t know what the ultimate outcome of tariffs is going to be, and it’s impossible to tell whether there’s been a big sudden drop-off in subscribers as a result of Musk,” said Cotton Swindell, who helps oversee about $2.8 billion as senior portfolio manager for the Adams Diversified Equity Fund, which holds the stock. “But these issues are out there, and any change in sentiment can have an impact.”
A Netflix spokesperson didn’t respond to a Bloomberg News request for comment.
While the implications of both developments are hazy, it had made it more difficult for Netflix to find a direction. Still, they remain up 36% this year, more than three times the 6.9% gain in Musk’s Tesla Inc. and well above the Nasdaq 100’s 20% rise. The company’s valuation is high as well at about 37 times estimated earnings, compared with 27.6 for the tech-heavy index.
“Netflix is a core subscription for most people, and there are few substitutes for the value consumers get,” said John Cervantes, senior investment adviser at Prime Capital Financial. “I’d be surprised if these issues represent much of a headwind.”
That probably explains why Wall Street doesn’t seem too concerned. Seaport Global Securities upgraded the stock to buy earlier this week, touting ongoing market-share gains compared with linear television, “but also the continued professional, curated content that is driving engagement leadership.” Analyst David Joyce doesn’t cite politics as a reason for the recent stock weakness. Instead, he attributes it to Netflix digesting its year-to-date gains and expects revenue improvement from its advertising business in the coming months.
Content remains a bright spot. In addition to , the company said it drew over 41 million viewers for a boxing match. Netflix also released the second season of its popular show last month, and the final episodes of its hit will be released this holiday season.
Download data from Sensor Tower last month showed a slight increase from the third quarter of 2024, putting “the streaming service in a strong position to deliver on 3Q revenue guidance of 17% growth,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff announcement echoed a similar one from May, when he called films produced overseas a national security threat. Netflix shares shrugged off the issue at the time, and nothing meaningful came of the threat.
As for Musk’s boycott, it’s difficult to assess how widespread it is, unlike the controversy surrounding Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores Inc. or the recent push to cancel streaming services from Walt Disney Co., which contributed to the company reversing a decision to briefly remove late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel from the air. The Tesla CEO’s issue with Netflix appears to stem from comments made by the creator of about the killing of political activist Charlie Kirk.
“We’ve seen that premature selling on initial tariff headlines isn’t a good strategy,” Prime Capital’s Cervantes said. “We’ve also seen so many of these culture-war trading issues that I suspect we’ll be moving onto something else soon.”
Earnings estimates have basically held for Netflix’s third-quarter results, which will be released later this month, and the full year. The company no longer reports subscriber figures, but according to Bloomberg consensus estimates, analysts see more than 5.8 million subscriber additions in the quarter, bringing its global subscribers to over 315.5 million.
Netflix co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters, speaking at the Bloomberg Screentime conference on Wednesday, said the company is making its video games available for play on TVs for the first time as part of its ongoing push to extend its reach beyond just films and TV shows.
Netflix’s hold on audiences is clear beyond its major titles. Streaming viewership for its “dwarfed” the debut of on HBO Max, even though the Netflix film didn’t play in theaters or have a meaningful marketing campaign, according to Richard Greenfield, an analyst at the technology, media and telecommunications research firm Lightshed Partners.
All of which is why bulls have a strong long-term belief in the company. As for Netflix shares, the valuation is clearly giving investors pause, which opens the door for selling based on threats from Trump and Musk.
“I’d characterize both as short-term issues and headline risks,” Adams Funds’ Swindell said. “But the valuation means there’s not as much room for missteps, and clearly the market is either seeing added risk or added concern about Netflix’s ability to execute.”"

C is one of the top recommended stocks.
Craig Irwin, Roth Capital senior research analyst, said in a recent program on CNBC that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has “lots of room to run” because of its auto business, robo taxis and other catalysts. Here is how the analyst made his case for the company:
“The reason they’re beating this quarter is because the federal EV tax credit is going away, right? There’s a small pull forward of demand, and then everybody else has been building these compliance businesses and these businesses to actually grab the subsidies instead of doing what Elon Musk is doing — building a great company, right? All those guys are retreating from the market. So the market’s going to mix towards Tesla over the next several quarters,” Irwin said.
The analyst said people “don’t care” if robotaxis are delayed and argued that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is better than Alphabet’s Waymo.
“Waymo got three monkeys in the back seat. Let’s talk about tele-operation engineers — three drivers, not one. Tesla’s going to do better than that. Right. So the potential for a trillion-dollar valuation around the robo taxi business is huge. People will discount that out. Elon is back. He’s in the saddle. He’s a wildly creative guy, free thinker, which was held against him for a little while. But you know what? He is an alchemist, and this stock’s going to work.”

Can Musk really solve all of Tesla's long-term issues? Tesla’s recently reported strong Q3 deliveries, as expected, amid a temporary boost due to pull-forward demand as a result of the end of EV tax credits. Tesla’s latest announcement of cheap models failed to impress the market. It also shows Tesla is losing pricing power amid intense competition. Cheaper models are also expected to negatively impact its auto margins. In Europe, the new budget models will face intense competition from European and Chinese brands, which are already offering some models under or near $30,000.
In 2024, Tesla's global deliveries fell for the first time, while the company is expected to see another 10% this year, Reuters reported. China’s BYD recently reported a whopping 800% increase in UK sales, and the company is beating Tesla in most of Europe.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

The move comes via Intel's new Intel Robotics AI Suite software package, which includes things like advanced algorithms and vision-language models, as well as its Panther Lake chip. Combined, the company said, they'll help developers build robotics, such as individual robotic arms for future humanoid robots.
""Effectively, this is a Panther Lake that has almost 200 TOPS [trillions of operations per second] worth of performance and can run one of these humanoid robots on a board that's the size of your passport,"" Mike Masci, vice president of product management with Intel's Edge Computing Group, told Yahoo Finance, adding that this highlights the latest chips' power and energy efficiency.
""We're proving to the industry, effectively, the myth of x86 not being able to be low power and not being able to fit into these unique form factors; we're just basically challenging every one of those paradigms,"" he added.
The tech industry is in the midst of an enormous race to create practical humanoid robots, with companies including Tesla (TSLA), Agility Robotics, Apptronik, and Boston Dynamics competing to be the first to bring the machines to market.
And like Intel, Big Tech companies are keen on getting in on the action, with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) developing and powering the AI that brings robots to life.
We're still quite a way away from humanoid robots folding our clothes or taking the dog for a walk, but in the meantime, Intel said there are plenty of real-world applications for robotics software and chips that are being used today.
""Just one example is order accuracy in retail stores,"" explained Matthew Formica, senior director and head of edge product marketing at Intel.
""In fast food, you order online from Uber Eats ... When that order is fulfilled, it's humans putting the food into the bag, but increasingly they're trying to remove errors. There are solutions now to put a camera that points at what the person's doing that [compares] the order with what they're actually putting in the bag, and using the same [vision-language model]-style technology to have a deep understanding of what those items are.""
If someone forgets to add a soda to an order or puts in the wrong kind of burger, Formica explained, the system can then flag it and ensure they drop in the right product.
""So while humanoids are sort of the tip of the spear ... there's a lot of real markets today where the application of that technology is much more real,"" he added."

Oct 9 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has confirmed the company's investment in Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, and says he wishes he had gone in even bigger.
Speaking with CNBC, Huang described the financing opportunity as exciting and added that he wants to be involved in everything Musk does. Musk, who leads Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX, continues to expand his reach across AI, space, and advanced tech ventures.
Huang also mentioned he regrets not putting more capital into CoreWeave (CRVW), a fast-growing AI data center firm closely tied to Nvidia's hardware ecosystem. The comments followed news of Nvidia's separate agreement with OpenAI, where the chipmaker plans to invest up to $100 billion over time to support at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers built with Nvidia's systems.
Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has struck its own deal with OpenAI to deploy six gigawatts of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs, with the first phase expected in 2026. As AI infrastructure spending accelerates, Nvidia remains at the center of the industry's biggest partnerships and capital flows.
Is NVDA Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 54 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $215.19 with a high estimate of $389.73 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +13.79% from the current price of $189.11.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for NVIDIA Corp in one year is $321.25, suggesting a upside of +69.87% from the current price of $189.11. Gf value is Gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Las Vegas Sands and Alibaba are in the spotlight.
What do these two stocks have in common? Well, they are both closely tied to the National Basket Association, which just announced a return to China for the first time since a tense parting of ways in 2019.
Now the NBA will play two pre-season games at Sands China's Macau gambling resort, and it's launching a multi-year AI and cloud partnership with Alibaba.
Sands is up in early trade but only very slightly, while Alibaba is down in Hong Kong and New York.
Now, there's one Chinese bank stock you probably wish you'd owned this morning.
Hang Seng shares surged more than 25% after its longtime majority shareholder, HSBC, launched a $13 billion offer to privatize Hang Seng Bank Bank.
Now, on the other hand, HSBC shares, well they fell 6% as the deal would suspend share buybacks to conserve capital.
One more name in Asia, Fast Retailing, the owner of Unilo.
Shares climbed over 3% on Thursday after the company reported strong full-year results. Fast Retailing reported full-year operating profit growth of 12.6% year-on-year.
The company said these results mark the fourth consecutive record annual performance and that its new stores had been, quote, hugely successful.
Jefferies is also trending after a steep drop in Wednesday session of nearly 8%, but it's now recovering. It was up at one point in pre-market by nearly 5%, now just over 1% higher.
And it which followed the disclosure that one of Jeffries's credit funds had more than $700 million exposure linked to the bankrupt auto parts company, First Brands.
Now finally, probably the biggest stock move this morning, Ferrari. The Italian luxury car stock is deep in the red, both in New York and in Milan after the company revealed new details of its first fully electric model set to debut next year.
It's the biggest decline for Ferrari since 2016.
The thing is, demand for luxury EVs is cooling. Even high-end brands like Porsche and Mercedes have reported softer sales and scaling back production targets.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s aware of 58 incidents — including instances in which Teslas drove in the wrong direction on a road — that involved the driver-assistance system marketed as Full Self-Driving. The so-called preliminary evaluation involves an estimated 2.9 million vehicles, according to a filing posted on the agency’s website.

Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The probe broadens the scrutiny of Tesla’s driver-assistance technology and adds to other investigations into the automaker’s doors, Autopilot features and whether it’s reporting crashes in a timely manner. NHTSA said last year that it was looking into whether FSD has the ability to detect and appropriately respond to fog and other reduced visibility conditions.
The system known as FSD is central to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s longstanding effort to develop driverless cars. While drivers are required to constantly supervise when the system is in use, Musk has predicted that drivers in certain states will soon no longer need to pay attention when FSD is engaged.
Tesla shares fell 1.4% as of 8:02 a.m. before regular trading in New York. The stock gained about 9% this year through Wednesday’s close.
Several of the incidents cited in the new probe resulted in crashes and injuries, NHTSA said. None of the incidents in the scope of its current investigation involve a fatality.
The regulator said it had identified six reports where a Tesla vehicle with FSD engaged “approached an intersection with a red traffic signal, continued to travel into the intersection against the red light and was subsequently involved in a crash” with other vehicles.
Multiple incidents occurred at the same intersection in Maryland. NHTSA said Tesla has since taken action to address the issue at this intersection.
The probe was opened to assess the “scope, frequency and potential safety consequences” of the FSD behavior cited in the incidents, NHTSA said.

However, the streaming specialist recently encountered a bit of an issue. Elon Musk, the famous CEO of Tesla and the wealthiest person in the world, called for Netflix's subscribers to cancel their subscriptions over some controversy surrounding a character from an animated show on the platform, leading to a one-day, 5% decline in Netflix's stock.
Is this a bad sign for Netflix, or just a one-off event that won't have much of an effect on the company's long-term performance?
Looking at some precedents
It's not the first time a famous person with a large following has made a comment about a company that tanked its share price. In fact, Musk has been involved in a similar incident before. On May 1, 2020, he claimed on a social media post that Tesla's stock price was too high, leading to a one-day 10% drop for the electric vehicle maker's stock. However, even with significant headwinds and volatility recently, Tesla outperformed the market since then.
There are cases in which a company performed terribly over five years (or so) after seeing its stock price drop significantly because of something a famous person said, but that was almost certainly because of the company's own shortcomings.
Kylie Jenner famously sent Snap stock prices down significantly on Feb. 21, 2018, after she publicly stated that she doesn't use Snapchat anymore. The company has significantly lagged the market since then, but only after its shares soared in the early days of the pandemic. In other words, the problem isn't Jenner's comments, but Snap's poor financial results.
These examples may not be identical to Netflix's recent debacle, but here's the critical point, which economist Benjamin Graham, father of value investing and mentor to Warren Buffett, said: ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.""
So, investors should look past the noise and cut through the short-term sentiment. Whether Netflix's shares remain attractive right now has little to do with Musk's comments and depends, instead, on the company's underlying business. Let's turn our attention to that.
Netflix stock is still a buy
Netflix is the world's leading streaming company. It has been a pioneer in this field and built a strong brand that grants it significant pricing power. Over time, Netflix increased its prices while continuing to grow its ecosystem of viewers, which speaks volumes about the company.
The company's financial results remain excellent. In the second quarter, its revenue increased by 15.9% year over year to $11.1 billion, while its earnings per share came in at $7.19, 47.3% higher than in the same period last year. Netflix's free cash flow was $2.3 billion, 86.9% higher than the prior-year quarter.
Netflix credited member growth for its strong Q2 results. The company's significant ecosystem of viewers -- which is deeper than that of any of its streaming competitors -- grants it another advantage. Thanks to the significant data on viewing habits it possesses, Netflix can create shows (or license ones) that cater to viewer preferences, leading to even more engagement, more data, and better content production decisions, a wonderful illustration of the network effect.
Netflix's vast ecosystem and the data at its disposal should also allow its relatively new ad business to be massively successful. A few years ago, the company introduced a low-price ad-supported tier to cater to more price-sensitive customers, one of several initiatives it launched to maintain its position amid growing competition. The company also cracked down on password sharing.
These efforts have been successful, and despite the increase in the number of streaming platforms, Netflix remains in an excellent position. Finally, the company still has plenty of white space to exploit.
Netflix estimated a more than $650 billion opportunity, which is severely underpenetrated. Thanks to its strong economic moat and excellent execution, the company should ride the streaming tailwind for years, delivering strong returns along the way. Regardless of Musk's recent comments, the stock remains attractive to long-term investors."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -When Tesla's board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of “Mars-shot milestones” to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years.
The board’s proposal said Musk would have to “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get “zero” unless he meets those “incredibly ambitious” goals.
Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving.
He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board’s easier goals that won’t necessarily revolutionize Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found.
Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple's Tim Cook, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar.
Musk’s vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That’s a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024.
On Tuesday, Tesla unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales.
Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters.
Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: ""The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met.""
The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven-and-a-half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them."

Last year, Tesla rallied thousands of mom-and-pop retail investors to vote their shares of stock in favor of Musk’s billions in pay. Now, Tesla is teeing up retail holders for another vote on Nov. 6 that would set Musk on the path to becoming the world’s first trillionaire by granting him up to 12% of Tesla’s outstanding shares divided into 12 tranches through a restricted stock grant. The first tranche starts at $2 trillion, and the final tranche is $8.5 trillion. If he hits all the goals in the plan, he’ll have brought Tesla to a market cap of $8.5 trillion, and his stake would be worth more than $1 trillion. Much of the playbook for 2025 is similar to 2024: a slick investor website, a bevy of posts, and engagement on X about how investors can vote shares on specific brokerage platforms, and even a special video with Optimus humanoid robots explaining voting in between taking a sauna and overseeing platters of bagels and cream cheese.
Tesla is clearly dedicating resources to communicating with its individual retail investors and informing them about how to vote, independent activist investor Michael Levin told Fortune, a feat that is difficult to accomplish in the U.S. Given how Tesla pulled it off last year, this year’s vote to approve Musk’s new award isn’t nearly as in doubt as it was in 2024, he said. Plus, Tesla has the same playbook to work from this year.
“The result of 2024 gives a very strong clue about how 2025 will work out—and that passed with 72% of voters supporting it, and that’s pretty comfortable,” Levin said. “This year, it’s sort of a version of the same thing: A comp plan going forward with these insane, ambitious goals, and people are fine with that and don’t mind him being a trillionaire.”
Thousands of retail investors and Tesla loyalists have pledged their support in favor of Tesla and Musk’s stratospheric new pay plan, but a growing coalition of pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are speaking out about what they see as red flags: a comp package that is too large, a lack of independence on the board, and the potential for other founders and controlling CEOs to follow in Musk’s footsteps. The latter would be disastrous for an economy that is already tilted too favorably in the direction of billionaires like Musk while employees writ large are battling inflation and lackluster pay raises, sources said."

TSMC (2330.TW, TSM)
Another chipmaker in focus on Thursday was TSMC (2330.TW, TSM), after the company reported stronger-than-expected sales in the third quarter.

This was ahead of an LSEG Smart Estimate of NT$973.26bn, based on forecasts from 22 analysts, according to a Reuters report. Converted into US dollars (USD) the third quarter figure came in at $32.43bn, which would be around the middle of TSMC's guidance for the period of $31.8bn to $33bn, which it gives in USD.
Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, said TSMC (2330.TW, TSM) was ""benefitting hugely from the boom in AI demand"".
""TSMC (2330.TW, TSM) is the most technologically advanced manufacturer of the chips that designers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) are creating to power AI technology,"" he said.

MARANELLO, Italy (Reuters) -Ferrari (RACE) has unveiled the technology which will power its hotly-anticipated first electric car, the Elettrica, as the 78-year-old luxury Italian sportscar maker looks to add battery power to its hybrid and petrol-engine models.
In a closely-guarded event at its Maranello headquarters, a Ferrari-red cover was pulled back on a stage to reveal the Elettrica's production-ready chassis: a car base, with battery pack and electric motor, though with no wheels or outer shell.
The completed car, which Ferrari is expected to present next year at a global premiere, will have a top speed of 310 kilometres per hour (193 miles) - slightly slower than most of its engined models and a range of at least 530 km.
The four-door, four-plus seat car will have a specially-designed sound system to amplify actual vibrations from its powertrain to create a distinctly electric Ferrari sound, rather than just faking engine noise.
The unveiling of the inner workings of Ferrari's maiden electric car marks a milestone for the auto industry that is grappling more widely with a shift from the internal combustion engine to the electric battery.
""Today... is an historic day for us. We all have goosebumps,"" said CEO Benedetto Vigna, who said the electric car would complement, not replace, the company's existing models. ""The EV is an addition, not a transition.""
FERRARI NEEDS AN EV FOR NEXT GENERATION OF RICH KIDS
Like other high-performance brands, Ferrari has been cautious about electrification. Reuters reported in June that it had delayed a second EV model until 2028 because of a lack of demand. Rival Lamborghini, part of Volkswagen, has delayed its first EV until 2029, saying the market is not ready.
Luxury automaker Porsche (PAH3.DE, POAHY) forged ahead with EVs, but has been caught between a crowded Chinese market and Western buyers who still want Porsche's loud combustion engines. Delays to its EV roll-out have hit parent Volkswagen.
Ferrari is aiming to have 20% of its model line-up fully-electric by 2030, its long-term business plan unveiled on Thursday shows. That is below the 40% target it set for 2030 in its business plan three years ago.
Ferrari is under less pressure than mainstream automakers to go electric ahead of a 2035 European Union ban on new fossil-fuel car sales, as it can sell combustion-engine models running on higher-cost synthetic e-fuels its customers can afford.
But wealthy younger buyers are keen to go electric.
""If you think about the next generation of kids, to remain relevant, maybe Ferrari needs an electric line-up that represents the pinnacle of its type,"" former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer told Reuters."

The company delivered big time, reporting close to 497,100 deliveries, smashing Wall Street estimates of of 447,600. However, Tesla's stock dipped immediately following the news, as the strong beat was not enough to excite Wall Street. What gives?
Expiration of the EV tax credit
Tesla's third-quarter deliveries of nearly 497,100 blew out estimates and rose 7% year over year. That's a sharp reversal from the first two quarters of 2025, when the company reported deliveries that fell 12% year over year compared to the first half of 2024.
But analysts clearly knew the quarter was going to be strong because President Trump's big legislative spending bill passed by Congress earlier this year eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit on Sept. 30, the last day of the third quarter. It became evident that consumers would likely rush to purchase Teslas before the cost of the vehicles increased.
According to Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, Tesla saw a 35% year-over-year increase in its U.S. sales in the third quarter, which he attributes to the rush before the EV tax credit expiration. ""Investors should largely throw out the positive number,"" Munster said, noting that the ""the future will be autonomy.""
Still, other analysts were more optimistic. Morgan Stanley analyst said that Q3 deliveries came in at the top end of hedge fund estimates ranging from 450,000 to 500,000 deliveries. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called the quarter a ""massive bounceback"" and said he is still high on the company's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics businesses, which Ives and Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt think could catapult Tesla to a $2 trillion to $3 trillion market cap by 2026 or 2027.
Ultimately, I'm guessing the disappointing share action could be attributed to Tesla stock's recent run-up. The stock is up close to 60% over the past six months.
Current state of the bull-bear debate
Tesla is still one of if not the most hotly debated stocks on Wall Street, with the bulls confident that it is the most innovative AI company in the world and the bears pointing to its staggering valuation of nearly 250 times forward earnings. As of this writing, Tesla trades at nearly $440 per share. The lowest Wall Street price target is an astounding $19 per share, while the high is $600 per share, which shows just how split the Street is on the name.
But one thing I think both the bulls and bears agree on is that the future of Tesla is going to come down to its autonomous driving business, for which Tesla is in the early stages of building out an autonomous ride-hailing fleet, and the humanoid robots business. If these businesses are as successful as analysts like Ives believe, than the stock can keep moving higher. But hiccups or a more competitive market than people think could send it tumbling.
Tesla has begun to launch pilot autonomous driving programs in select cities, while humanoid robots are still in prototype stage. The advantage of Tesla's robotaxi business is that the vehicles can reportedly be built at a fraction of the cost of rival WayMo, which is also operating in several cities. However, it remains to be seen whether the technology can truly be perfected and deemed safe enough to be fully commercialized.
The simple reason I choose to avoid Tesla is that I think the market has assumed too much success in businesses that the public still knows far too little about. If Tesla is successful and jumps to $600 per share, that's 40% upside, but if robotaxis and humanoid robots don't work out as well as hoped, who knows that the stock is worth. As stocks get larger and surpass a $1 trillion market cap, maintaining the growth to hold such a high valuation becomes more difficult. The risk-reward proposition is not attractive to me."

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains a trend-setter in the automotive AI space. An analyst at Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating on the stock with $410 price target. In a recent investor note, the analyst said Tesla Q3 deliveries of about 497,000 beat the sell-side consensus expectation of 443,000 by 12% and came in at the high end of the buy side expectation range of 450,000-500,000. The strong Q3 delivery beat was likely driven by a demand pull-forward ahead of the expiry of EV consumer tax credits and marked the first year-over-year increase in deliveries this year, per the investor note by the analyst.

The company recently posted record third-quarter deliveries, and this week it unveiled ""Standard"" versions of the Model 3 and Model Y.
The electric-vehicle maker's timely launch of models priced below $40,000 may not only help sales trends in the near term, but it will also put more vehicles with self-driving technology on the road. This is important because Tesla is currently piloting an autonomous ride-sharing service called Robotaxi, which the company will eventually allow customers to deploy their self-driving-equipped cars into the fleet as part of a revenue-sharing program. In other words, these cheaper models -- assuming they help the company sell more vehicles -- are ultimately expanding the reach of the company's future Robotaxi service.
Lower entry prices, same autonomy technology
On Tuesday, Tesla added new Standard variants to its two best-selling vehicles. These new standard versions of Model Y and Model 3, which can both drive over 300 miles on a single charge, boast starting prices of $39,990 and $36,990, respectively. Importantly, these trims ship with Tesla's camera-based hardware platform, which enables Full Self-Driving (Supervised) -- a feature that customers can activate via a subscription. In other words, even the lower-priced versions keep buyers on the same autonomy-ready path as premium trims.
Cheaper, self-driving-equipped models enhance the bull case for Tesla stock for two reasons.
First, affordability expands the pool of potential buyers. Cheaper entry points can nudge potential buyers who were unsure and could even potentially attract entirely new prospective customers. Additionally, the lower price is particularly relevant after the recent expiration of the federal $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit.
Second, every new car delivered with the latest self-driving hardware grows the base of vehicles that could eventually be deployed in Tesla's robotaxi network (when the software is ready and regulations allow). And on this note, Tesla's limited pilot of the Robotaxi program in Austin today shows that this isn't just a Tesla shareholder pipedream anymore; real-world testing is underway, even if it is still restricted.
A key catalyst
Recently, Tesla posted shocking third-quarter delivery numbers that obliterated analyst estimates. Vehicles during the period came in at about 497,100 -- a company record and up more than 7% year over year.
But there's a downside to posting such a good Q3. Deliveries for the quarter, which were positively impacted by a pull-forward in demand as customers scrambled to buy a Tesla before the $7,500 electric vehicle credit expired on Sep. 30, far exceeded production. The company produced a total of 447,450 units during the quarter (compared to deliveries of more than 497,000). This lag, combined with the lack of a $7,500 incentive, will likely weigh on fourth-quarter deliveries.
Thankfully, however, Tesla's new standard versions of Model Y and Model 3 should help offset at least some of the challenges associated with demand for the quarter (whether they help contribute to the period's production and delivery numbers is unclear).
Importantly, investors should note that though these new standard models are available to order today, the first deliveries won't occur until later this year. For the new standard Model Y, Tesla's website shows availability beginning in the November to December timeframe. The website shows standard Model 3 availability beginning in the December 2025 to January 2026 timeframe.
While it's unclear how much the two new models will help Q4, one thing is clear: They'll almost certainly help boost volume in 2026 -- and their included self-driving hardware means they will help grow the company's Robotaxi-ready fleet. Ultimately, lower-priced, robotaxi-ready Tesla models support the long-term investment case for the growth stock. Lower entry points can accelerate fleet growth and shipping autonomy-capable hardware across that fleet bolsters the software monetization opportunity.
But there are some key risks for investors to keep in mind. The Robotaxi pilot is still limited in scope, and it's always possible that its rollout and the required regulatory approvals take longer than expected. Additionally, lower-cost models could pressure Tesla's profit margins. And finally, Tesla's valuation is high, with shares trading at more than 250 times earnings as of this writing. This means that much of the excitement surrounding lower-cost models, self-driving technology, and Robotaxi is already priced in."

Tesla Investment Narrative Recap
Anyone considering Tesla stock today needs to believe in the company's ability to scale both vehicle and software-driven revenue amid strong global competition and shifting incentive policies. The recent launch of ""lower-cost"" Model 3 and Model Y variants has disappointed some investors, as prices remain above the threshold to trigger mass adoption, potentially limiting the near-term catalyst of accelerating EV volume growth. While this announcement has impacted sentiment, it does not materially affect the immediate biggest risk: a drop in US demand following the expiration of the federal EV tax credit.
Among the various recent developments, Tesla's report of record-high deliveries, 497,000 vehicles in Q3, stands out, particularly in light of the new models' introduction. This achievement highlights the company's capacity to drive volume, but future momentum may depend on maintaining affordability strategies and government incentives, both of which were called into question by the latest product launch. Meanwhile, growing pressure from both global peers and regulatory changes remains front of mind for cautious investors.
In contrast, investors should be aware that the end of the US$7,500 federal EV tax credit could...

The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.58%.
Heading into today, shares of the electric car maker had gained 24.82% over the past month, outpacing the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 14.95% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.68%.
The upcoming earnings release of Tesla will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on October 22, 2025. On that day, Tesla is projected to report earnings of $0.5 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 30.56%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $25.85 billion, reflecting a 2.64% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.
For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $1.6 per share and a revenue of $92.85 billion, demonstrating changes of -33.88% and -4.96%, respectively, from the preceding year.
Investors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Tesla. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.3% higher. Tesla is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
With respect to valuation, Tesla is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 270.4. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 12.85.
We can also see that TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 11.3. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Automotive - Domestic industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.42 as of yesterday's close.
The Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 171, placing it within the bottom 31% of over 250 industries."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) just made its most popular SUV a bit more affordable. The company quietly listed a new $39,990 version of the Model Y on its website a move that's been anticipated for months, especially after the U.S. EV tax credit expired. The new rear-wheel-drive model offers 325 miles of range and can hit 125 mph, making it the most budget-friendly option in Tesla's lineup right now.
The new price is roughly 15% lower than the base version and signals Tesla's latest effort to keep sales humming as incentives fade and competition heats up. It also ends speculation that a completely new, ultra-cheap $25,000 Tesla was around the corner at least for now.
Tesla also trimmed the price of its standard Model 3 to $36,990, giving buyers another cheaper entry point. While the company topped delivery expectations in the third quarter, analysts warn that demand could cool over the next few quarters as many buyers rushed to take advantage of the now-expired EV tax credit.

used to work at Tesla. So I feel like I'd be I'd be remiss, John, if I didn't ask you about this. Musk did reveal these cheaper versions of the Model Y, Model 3. What do you make of it, John? I'm just curious to get your take. What what do you think it could mean for growth and margins at your former employer?
Well, I think we all know that the that the market for cars gets uh multiples larger as the price comes down. In other words, the largest market for cars is between 20 and $30,000. It's a huge sweet spot. Uh it's also large between 30 and 35,000. And so, uh you're seeing product uh in that in that market space like the uh like the Chevy Equinox, which is now the number two non- Tesla selling EV, just out of nowhere. It's exploded because it's a $35,000, $34,000 um small SUV uh that's got plenty of room and plenty of range.
I think in Tesla's case, this is what disruption looks like when a company starts to really mature. It's not disruptive, it's kind of iterative change. I think investors were looking for them to come down into that $25 to $35,000 range. And I think what Tesla's signaling is they're they're willing to iteratively change the product down to say $40,000, but they're putting all their capital in two other businesses, autonomous driving and robots. And so I don't think we're going to see disruptive change out of Tesla's car lineup would be my prediction. Um because uh because they're actually maturing and pointing their capital at two different opportunities now."

Well the net effect of President Trump's various trade wars are creating a dark cloud over automakers and Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian joins us now for a closer look. Pras.
Yeah, Josh, the hits keep coming for the auto industry in Trump's trade war. Moody's estimates that the hit to the automakers' operating profit this year from tariffs alone will be a staggering $30 billion. And this includes the effects of the framework trade deals between the US and the EU as well as Japan. Now mitigation efforts like raising prices and reducing options in cars, you heard that with Tesla, right? Can only go so far to help only go so far to help, Moody said, leaving only capital intensive options like localizing production and moving final assembly to the US. We did an analysis at the end of Q2 where we found the we found around 11.7 billion in tariff costs to date. So it seems there's still more pain to come in the back half of the year, unless of course tariffs are reduced or some sort of new plan is put in place to to bring those effects down.
Are there certain automakers who you would argue are relatively better positioned than others to just navigate all this?
You know, you could argue that that Ford is better positioned. They make about a significant amount. I mean 80 I think slightly over 80% of their vehicles are made in the US, right? But um, I need to check that. but around that. because they have a lot of US UAW workers here. But they also still do import the very popular Maverick from Mexico. So they're taking a tariff hit too and CEO Jim Farley's talked about it, how it's sort of I think he told Brian Sozzi that it's been hampering investment in this country because they have to pay all this money for tariffs, right? Companies like Toyota, you know, they build in the US but they have a huge exposure in Mexico as well as Japan. They're paying I think the biggest tariff bill of any of the automakers there uh to date. So uh those are the two companies that are sort of the two end points, you know, GM is in the middle somewhere, Stelantis of course in the middle somewhere. And then, you know, the Germans, you know, they're they're everything's from Germany, right? So they're they have a lot of difficulties there with the 15% tariff which is the framework. It's not fully signed yet, but that's what I supposedly is happening starting August 1st, so.
All right. Thank you Pras."

The Austin-based startup, which had raised $200 million in April, is back with another $1 billion in funding. The Series C round was led by Addition with participation from CapitalG, Elad Gil, Lightspeed, Ribbit, Thrive Capital, and Valor Equity Partners.
The new round values the company at $3 billion pre-money, according to The New York Times.
Base Power has sold more than 100 megawatt-hours’ worth of its home storage batteries in Texas — a notable figure considering the company was founded in 2023.
Base Power leases the batteries to homeowners, who pay between $695 and $995 upfront to install 25 kilowatt-hour or 50 kilowatt-hour batteries, both of which dwarf the competition. (For instance, the 25-kilowatt battery doubles a single Tesla Powerwall.) The batteries can keep a household powered for as long as 48 hours, according to the company.
Customers also pay a monthly fee ($19 or $29) and commit to buying electricity from Base Power for three years at 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour plus delivery fees.
By leasing the batteries, Base Power has lowered a significant hurdle for many homeowners: the upfront cost of home storage batteries. The batteries themselves run thousands of dollars for less storage capacity, not including installation costs.
Base Power has also taken advantage of Texas’ deregulated utility market, which allows households to easily switch electricity suppliers.
The state’s utility regulator handsomely rewards power providers that can respond quickly with large amounts of electricity when the grid needs it most, something grid-scale batteries excel at. In exchange for the low upfront cost, Base Power customers agree to allow the company to use the batteries to sell electricity back to the grid when they don’t need them for backup power.
In addition to expansion beyond Texas, the company is also planning to build a second battery factory in the United States. It is currently constructing its first factory near Austin, Texas."

Even Tesla’s biggest bull can’t spin this one: Elon Musk’s “affordable” EVs cost nearly $40,000 — cheaper on paper, not in practice
Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images
Elon Musk finally built the affordable Tesla he’s been promising since 2006 — he just forgot to make it affordable. The new “Standard” Model Y and Model 3 trims are set to debut at nearly $40,000 apiece, stripped of plenty of features but not of hubris, and even Tesla’s most loyal Wall Street evangelist, Dan Ives, says the discount is too small to matter.
Suggested Reading
“We [at Wedbush] believe the launch of a lower cost model represents the first step to getting back to a ~500k quarterly delivery run-rate which will be important to stimulate demand for its fleet with the EV tax credit expiring at the end of September,” Ives wrote in a Tuesday note, “but we are relatively disappointed with this launch as the price point is only $5k lower than prior Model 3’s and Y’s.”
Related Content
The lower-cost car announcement was supposed to reenergize Tesla’s sales pipeline after a bruising year of softening demand, lost subsidies, and political blowback. Instead, it’s being met with a shrug. As Ives noted, the “cheaper” versions cost about $5,000 less than the next trims up, but they arrive just a week after the federal EV tax credit expired — effectively wiping out the savings before anyone could feel them. For most buyers, these models don’t expand Tesla’s reach so much as rearrange its price tags.
Wall Street didn’t buy the announcement, either. Tesla’s stock dipped about 4% after the launch, erasing gains from the weekend teaser videos that had briefly stirred fan excitement.
The content of the cars tells the story better than the sticker. Tesla didn’t invent another model; it edited one already in circulation.
Gone are the leather seats, the heated back row, the power-adjust steering wheel, the LED light bar, and the second-row entertainment screen. The Model Y loses its panoramic glass roof; the Model 3 keeps it. Both shed about 20 miles of range and their most popular driver-assist feature, Autosteer. Both keep roughly the same range and shape but feel, in essence, like déjà vu with manual mirrors. Musk’s promise of a cheaper “mass-market Tesla” is still only being fulfilled in used-car listings.
Internally, Tesla had already abandoned plans for an all-new $25,000 model, redirecting resources toward robotaxis and AI. The “Standard” trims are then, all in all, a eulogy for a promise Musk made nearly two decades ago.
The discount that isn’t
The timing was convenient. The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit that effectively raised sticker prices across the industry hit just as Tesla’s leases got more expensive and its deliveries started to flatten. A modest price drop helps blunt the pain and the headline shock — but not the math. Buyers still pay more than they would have with the subsidy in place.
The company just reported record deliveries for the quarter, a surge widely attributed to customers rushing to beat the subsidy’s expiration — demand borrowed from the future, not created from scratch.
This model announcement is a psychological fix, not an economic one. The cheaper models are still more expensive than last quarter’s premium trims once the subsidy is factored in, which is why analysts like Ives, typically Musk’s loudest defenders, sound underwhelmed. Ives called it “a step in the right direction” that still leaves affordability “similar to when these vehicles had the tax credit applied.” That’s analyst code for: nice try.
Tesla’s problem right now isn’t just that it priced “affordable” too high; it’s that it’s run out of magic tricks. The company that once sold every quarter as a new frontier is now leaning on accounting choreography. Lower-content versions keep assembly lines busy and help hit delivery targets without retooling for an all-new model. This is a short-term fix for a long-term demand question — the kind of tactical move companies make when their next act isn’t quite ready for the curtain to come up.
AI dreams, human incentives
Musk’s next act is, officially, artificial intelligence. The same day Tesla rolled out the “Standard” EVs, it also released FSD 14.1, the first major Full Self-Driving update in a year, promising smarter detours, better emergency-vehicle detection, and fewer driver interventions. Ives argues AI is where the company’s real valuation lives.
“The AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun in our view with FSD and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the U.S. representing the golden goose for Musk & Co,” Ives wrote.
His note projects Tesla’s market cap could hit $2 trillion by in 2026 “in a bull case scenario” — and $3 trillion by the end of 2026 — robotaxis and humanoid robots enter production. The “affordable” cars, in that logic, are filler — a bridge until the AI story pays off.
But that bridge also leads directly to Musk’s wallet. In less than a month, shareholders will vote again on his proposed $1 trillion pay package, a compensation plan pegged to operational milestones such as vehicle deliveries and the rollout of autonomous systems — a plan that shareholders are pushing back against. Since that vote went public, Tesla has issued a drumbeat of good news: a $1 billion share purchase by Musk himself, early FSD releases, and now a “mass-market” launch that sounds good in headlines even if it adds little in substance. All of that represents the sort of narrative management that keeps sentiment — and the stock price — stable heading into a major payday.
Meanwhile, Tesla’s grip on its home turf is loosening. The company still dominates the U.S. EV market, but in Europe and China, it’s losing ground fast. BYD’s small cars start around $8,000, and its $25,000 Seagull and Xiaomi’s $35,000 YU7 make the $40,000 “Standard” Tesla look downright premium — and not in the good way. And European buyers have cooled on Musk himself after his overt flirtations with far-right politics.
At home, GM and Ford are rolling out $30,000-range EVs that nibble directly at Tesla’s supposed affordability lane. Against that backdrop, “Standard” doesn’t just seem to be the name of the trim; it’s a summary of Tesla’s ambition.
A cheaper car for an expensive problem
This is why Ives’ ambivalence matters. He’s not a skeptic; he’s a believer. Wedbush still rates Tesla “Outperform” and keeps a $600 price target, anchored on the idea that its AI-driven future — from FSD adoption to the coming “Cybercab” network — will unlock the next trillion dollars of value. But even he concedes that the so-called affordable launch “will be a hurdle,” with a price point that “remains relatively high versus other vehicles on the market.” In other words, the dream of mass-market EVs just got postponed — again.
What might make this moment sting even more for investors is just how un-Tesla it feels. This is a company that once defined progress by addition — more range, more features, more swagger. Now it’s selling subtraction as a strategy. Musk’s own language has shifted from disruption to endurance: keep use up, keep investors patient, keep faith in the AI future. But the symbolism of launching a cheaper, older car while pitching a robotaxi revolution is impossible to miss. It’s like a tech giant bragging about a discounted flip phone on the eve of inventing telepathy.
For all the talk of smarter neural networks and Cybercabs, FSD still functions as Tesla’s perennial mirage — progress that excites investors but doesn’t yet drive profit.
The generous interpretation of the model release is that Tesla is shoring up volume until the next leap arrives. The less generous one — the one even Ives half-implies — is that Tesla has become a company managing its narrative more than its innovation. It’s holding the line, not moving it. In that sense, Tesla’s new trims don’t just mark a cooling of its own ambition — they capture where the whole EV market finds itself: competing on price, not possibility.
If this is Tesla’s first step toward reigniting demand, it’s a small one. Musk can still talk about robotaxis and trillion-dollar roadmaps, but the story on the ground is simpler: The company that once sold the future is now selling a slightly cheaper version of the past. And even its biggest fan on Wall Street isn’t pretending that’s progress."

“Global carmakers, explicitly or implicitly, indicated US tariffs will cut their [2025] operating profitability by more than $30 billion,” Moody’s Ratings said in a report. “Though the companies' disclosure parameters differed, the guidance points to a tariff impact equivalent to more than one-fifth of the operating profit the same companies generated in 2024.”
Moody’s said tariffs would hit profit margins to the tune of 100-150 basis points. And with third quarter earnings season coming up, more disclosures are coming.
The guidance on tariff impact incorporates the framework trade agreement between the EU and US, as well as the trade agreement with Japan. While this does provide some certainty, Moody’s noted, deals between the US, Mexico, and Canada, where negotiations are stalled, are uncertain at best.
The trade deal between the US and Korea — home to Hyundai (005380.KS) and Kia (000270.KS) — also remains uncertain.
Mitigation efforts and solutions can be complex or ineffective.
“Automakers will continue to try to offset tariffs by reducing amenities in their vehicles and raising prices, which are less complex to implement and make more sense while the situation remains fluid,” Moody’s said.
Moody’s notes several automakers, including Volvo, Korea’s Hyundai and Kia, and even GM, have adjusted their production footprints and localized manufacturing to tackle tariffs.
GM said it will spend $4 billion in additional investment to increase manufacturing volume and add new vehicles to its US manufacturing.
But this also has its drawbacks.
“Implementation of these more structural mitigation measures take an extended period of time and likely require additional investments by automakers and their suppliers,” Moody’s said.
With third quarter earnings season coming up, automakers will disclose updated metrics on how bad the tariff pain has become.
A prior Yahoo Finance analysis found that the cumulative tariff hit from the largest automakers following the end of the June quarter stands at around $11.7 billion, per automakers' financial disclosures. Toyota (TM) had the largest exposure, followed by Volkswagen (VWAGY), GM (GM), Ford (F), Honda (HMC), and others. China's top automakers were excluded from the list as they do not operate in the US.
Even Tesla (TSLA), which makes all of its vehicles in the US, had a significant tariff impact from duties on auto parts like batteries for EVs.

Shares are tumbling as reality sets in.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ae0a1f03e30a63d9e7c27ad159942c25e2fa75684e89def14d2b51c7f797d501,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/why-archer-aviation-stock-is-falling-today/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/why-archer-aviation-stock-is-falling-today/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/why-archer-aviation-stock-is-falling-today/,fool.com,200,,"Shares of the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company Archer Aviation (ACHR -0.08%) are coming in for a hard landing today as investors begin to realize that Tesla's announcement yesterday has nothing to do with aviation.
Archer's stock spiked yesterday on hopes that the eVTOL industry might get some more important news from Tesla entering the market, but the company's announcement was instead focused solely on EVs. As a result, Archer Aviation's shares were down by more than 10% earlier this morning, and had given up 6.5% as of 11:24 a.m. ET.
Archer's stock lifted on speculation, fell on facts
The burgeoning eVTOL market has many investors excited about the prospects of personal aviation transportation, and that's led Archer's share price to experience frequent dramatic price swings.
That was in full effect yesterday when Archer investors pushed its share price higher, partially on speculation that there might be a partnership between Archer and Tesla. Last week, Archer posted a social media video of its Midnight eVTOL next to a Tesla Optimus robot and one of Tesla's EVs. Tesla's cryptic social media posts also spurred speculation that an entirely new product may be announced.
But Tesla's announcement turned out to be just about its own vehicles, specifically cheaper versions of its Model Y and Model 3. That disappointment is bringing Archer's shares back down today.
Sky-high expectations
Archer's share price has soared 267% over the past 12 months, but the company doesn't yet have any revenue. Archer is working on getting full regulatory approvals for its commercial eVTOL, but, as today's fall in stock price indicates, the stock could remain volatile as it works toward that goal."

Well Tesla unveiling cheaper versions of its popular Model Y and Model 3. It's part of an effort to boost sales after the federal EV tax credit expiration. Joining me now, Garrett Nelson, CFRA analyst. Garrett, good to see you. The shares fell yesterday, they're falling a little bit more today. Does this make a difference? Are you are we going to see any kind of boost to sales from these cheaper models?
Sure, thanks for having me. We do think it will help them from a sales volume perspective. Um, but only on the margin. Uh, it it's really inevitable that Tesla is going to experience a pretty significant drop off in sales volume uh starting this quarter, starting in Q4. Um, the the um, expiration of the federal EV tax credit is just too great of a uh an event to to prevent that. And um it it's at a time where EV sales are cooling across the board as is. Um, and so this really doesn't help. And um, you know, I think the announcement was a big disappointment. I think there was speculation that a lot of investors uh were thinking they might finally unveil the Roadster, which they promised uh a long time ago or some other uh model which which didn't happen.
Um, and you know, something that our uh motor reporter Pros Romani was pointing out earlier is, if you get rid of the tax credit and you have the cheaper base price of these lower priced vehicles, is the car still more expensive than it would have been with the tax credit?
Yeah, it's a close call. You really have to uh, you know, do do a a case study analysis and exactly what you're getting for that money. Um, which is a stripped down version. It's a it's a less expensive, but it's uh has less features, a lower range, um, just not the same uh type of quality of vehicle that um as a standard Tesla vehicle. So, it's really a trade-off and I think the question is how much demand is there at this point for for Tesla vehicles? Um, we know they've been losing market share in the EV market uh in the US, in Europe, and China, uh so far in 2025. They did have a much better than expected third quarter in terms of uh deliveries, but but still, if you look at their year-to-date market share, um it's lower than it was a year ago. And so, um, you know, it EV sales are cooling, the EV tax credit expiration um isn't going to help. And we think really the smartest thing that Tesla could do would be to introduce a hybrid vehicle because that is a market that is growing very fast. If you look hybrid sales in the US were up 37% last year, which compares to only 7% growth for for pure battery EVs. So that's, you know, something we think Tesla should think about."

The robotaxi service delivered over 2.2 million fully driverless rides in the second quarter of 2025, representing 148% year-over-year growth and signalling robust operational momentum as the platform scales globally.
Strategic partnerships with Uber and Lyft mark a pivotal shift in Baidu's international expansion strategy. These collaborations will deploy thousands of Apollo Go vehicles across Asia, the Middle East and Europe, leveraging established mobility platforms to accelerate market entry while maintaining an asset-light model. The approach addresses previous concerns about capital intensity in autonomous vehicle deployment and creates pathways to higher-margin international markets where ride fares substantially exceed those in China.
The unit economics story strengthens the investment thesis considerably. Apollo Go achieved unit-level profitability in Wuhan, where taxi fares run approximately 30% below tier-one Chinese cities and significantly under international market rates. This operational efficiency, combined with RT6, the world's first purpose-built Level 4 autonomous vehicle with the lowest-in-class unit costs, positions Baidu to capture substantial value in premium fare markets overseas. The Hong Kong expansion into complex right-hand drive environments demonstrates technical capabilities that few competitors have achieved at commercial scale.
As Baidu diversifies its revenue base, Apollo Go’s contribution could become increasingly meaningful. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.34 billion, reflecting a 9.33% year-over-year decline as the company transitions toward a more balanced mix beyond online marketing. However, Apollo Go’s expanding international operations and improving unit economics are expected to offset this temporary softness over time. With proven technology, operational efficiency, and growing global reach, Apollo Go remains well-positioned to power Baidu’s next phase of long-term growth.
Competition Heats Up in Global Autonomous Mobility
Baidu faces intensifying competition in autonomous driving from Tesla TSLA and Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo, both of which are scaling similar driverless mobility initiatives. Tesla continues expanding its Full Self Driving technology through over-the-air updates, enhancing its capability for wider commercial deployment across global markets. Alphabet’s Waymo, meanwhile, is ramping operations in the United States with growing ride-hailing coverage and stronger fleet utilization metrics. While Baidu’s Apollo Go focuses on mass market robotaxi commercialisation, Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo are reinforcing their positions in premium autonomous transport, underscoring the race for global leadership in self-driving innovation."

Tesla, the shares are rebounding a little bit this morning, Pras, after the introduction of its new cheaper Model Y and Model 3, but they fell about 4 and a half% yesterday. What's the sort of word on the street about the reception here?
You know, I think it was sort of expected that the new cheaper Model Y would come out that car uh starting a shade under $40,000. It de-contented version with, you know, uh lighting that's not as complex, uh cloth materials inside the seats, uh things like that, uh a battery that's maybe not as large. So we were expecting that. But one thing that caught people a little bit off by surprise was the cheaper model 3, uh which is the sedan, which actually costs a shade around 30, a shade under 37,000. I think that's an interesting value proposition for for Tesla here as they try to recoup some sales from the loss of the EV tax credit. The question is Julie, you know, even with these these cheaper models, they're not as cheap as the original cars were with the tax credit. So that's a big I think issue that are you going to get buyers when you're going to pay I actually $2,000 more dollars for a car that's less or just not as good as the past car before. So, I think that's the big question for Tesla as we enter Q4 and this sort of this post EB tax credit world.
That is a really good point that they're marketing it as a cheaper vehicle, but of course, you have to account for the lack of of tax credit. Um, something I have not thought enough about."

In a note to clients, Stifel said it believes “Tesla is making progress with modest advancements in its Robotaxi network and FSD.”
The firm added that Tesla has “high expectations for its camera-based approach,” which includes “Unsupervised FSD to be available for personal use in the United States by year-end 2025,” a goal that “appears to be a stretch but seems more likely in the medium term.”
Stifel said its new valuation reflects “20-25x projected 2025 EBITDA for the core business” and partial weightings for estimated upside from FSD, Robotaxis, and Optimus.
The analysts attributed $213 per share of value to FSD, $140 to Robotaxis, and $29 to Optimus.
The note highlighted the initial launch of Tesla’s Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, where “the company launched its robotaxi service in June with limited service,” using “Model Ys with Tesla’s FSD stack” and a “human ‘safety monitor’ that sits in the passenger seat.”
Tesla has also received permits to test autonomous vehicles in Nevada and Phoenix, with expansion plans under consideration for Florida and New York, according to Stifel.
The analysts added that the Trump administration’s support for self-driving technology, including the Autonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act of 2025, could help Tesla by “exempting some [vehicles] from safety requirements and easing reporting safety incidents.”
Stifel concluded, “We are bumping our target price to $483 from $440 to reflect more confidence in FSD and Robotaxi.”

Today's Featured Research Reports
Tesla's shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+85.4% vs. +72.9%). The company's EV sales are feeling the heat from rising global competition. After recording its first-ever annual decline in deliveries in 2024, the slump has continued into 2025, with drops in both the first and second quarters.
Automotive margins are shrinking, and operating expenses are rising. Discouragingly, Musk expects the upcoming quarters to be rough. Still, there are a few bright spots. The Energy Generation & Storage unit remains a core strength, and the Supercharger network continues to expand.
Tesla has also launched its robotaxi service, though early reactions have been mixed. But the company believes that it holds significant cost and scalability advantages. If Tesla can deliver on its promises, this could be a major growth driver. Until then, caution is key.
(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)
Shares of UnitedHealth have underperformed the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (-37% vs. -31.3%). The company is facing persistent cost pressures, higher medical utilization, and an elevated debt burden threatening near-term margin stability. The Zacks analyst expects the MCR to increase to 89.4% in 2025. Its trimmed 2025 earnings outlook, coupled with a premium valuation and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, adds to investor caution.
Also, operations of Optum Rx will likely take a hit from the current administration's policies on PBMs. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. Nevertheless, UnitedHealth continues to benefit from balanced growth across both its segments, supported by rising healthcare demand and disciplined execution.
Consistent revenue gains, strong commercial enrollment and resilient cash flows highlight its scale advantage and diversified business mix. Optum's expanding technology and value-based care operations further enhance long-term growth visibility.

Shopify's shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+99.2% vs. +51%). The company prospect is benefiting from an expanding merchant base. New merchant-friendly tools like Shop Minis, Shop Cash, and Sign in with Shop along with Shop Pay solutions are helping SHOP win merchants regularly.
Shopify's investment in AI-driven tools, such as Catalog, Universal Cart, and Sidekick, is helping merchants improve customer engagement and streamline operations. Shopify's expanding international footprint with strong growth in Europe is a key catalyst. A rich partner base is helping SHOP expand its merchant base. Strong free cash flow margin reflects solid liquidity.
However, Shopify faces gross margin pressure due to higher hosting costs, the three-month paid trial program, and the expanded PayPal partnership, which carries lower margins. Higher operating expenses are expected to hurt operating profit.

Shares of Waterstone Financial have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Savings and Loan industry over the past year (+14.9% vs. +10.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $285.60 million demonstrates earnings resilience with 35.2% YoY net income growth in Q2 2025, despite mortgage banking headwinds. Improved ROA (1.39%) and ROE (9.04%) highlight enhanced profitability, driven by cost discipline and operational efficiency.
The Community Banking segment delivered robust income growth via reduced compensation and occupancy costs, offsetting margin compression from deposit pricing. A sustained 15 cents dividend underscores capital strength and shareholder focus. Credit quality remains stable, with minimal provisioning needs and improved residential loan performance.
However, mortgage banking remains a drag with declining originations, shrinking margins and weak operating leverage. Persistent unrealized securities losses ($20.5 million) and rising CRE non-accruals introduce valuation and credit risks. Shares trade below peers at 0.83x P/B and 13.39x P/E.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the trending stocks.
Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in a latest program on CNBC that the end of EV tax credits could bode well for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) because its competitors have been “under-investing” in the space, which is likely to give the Musk-led company an edge in the Full Self-Driving race.
“Since the beginning of the year when this became clear, we saw GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and Toyota all make comments about cutting their EV factory output, the number of models, and in general think about a 20 to 30% cut just over the past few months. The reason why I mentioned that commentary from people who are buying Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) now about FSD, because they get that three-month free trial, is that in fact if these traditional car companies have taken the bait and decided to pull back investment in EVs because of the removal of the tax credit, it puts them in an awkward position. What’s going to happen with autonomy is it’s not going to slowly improve. We’re going to have this breakthrough moment. And for traditional auto to monetize this, they have to have an electric fleet. You’re not going to have a gas-powered EV. That’s just not going to happen. So by them essentially underinvesting, they’re not going to get to scale. It’s a catch-22. And I think they’ve really read the tea leaves wrong in terms of how to invest around the removal of the tax credit,” Munster said.
Munster said that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has been making EVs “profitably” while its competitors are losing money.
“Then there’s this other part of the equation about where they are with FSD and how close we are. From that perspective, it’s really coming down to two companies. It’s coming down to Tesla and then I think what’s going on with Waymo. I do want to mention Tesla and what they’ve been doing in Austin has been slower on the robo taxi. I believe they’re seeing more interventions than they were hoping for, which has caused that slowdown. And I think it does speak to the fact that we’re just not there yet. But I think we will have a moment. It’s not going to be linear. I think it’s going to be a breakout moment when it comes to the ability of these models to drive safely.”
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

But these are just more affordable versions of its popular Model 3 and Model Y. The move comes as the EV pioneer tries to revive demand and defend its turf amid rising competition and the loss of U.S. EV tax incentives. But are these new models really the game-changer Tesla needs—or just a short-term patch?
A Cheaper Entry Into Tesla’s Lineup
The new Model 3 Standard and Model Y Standard start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively, making them the cheapest Tesla cars so far. That’s about $5,000-$5,500 less than the “Premium” versions, which previously held the title of Tesla’s most affordable options.
To achieve these lower price points, Tesla has stripped out several comfort and tech features. Gone are Autosteer, the rear passenger touchscreen, seat heating and the LED light bar in the Model Y. Both vehicles now have manual side mirrors, textile seats (with optional vegan leather in the Model 3) and fewer speakers.
While these changes trim costs, the cars still deliver solid performance, each offering a range above 300 miles on a 69-kWh battery. Deliveries of these vehicles are expected between November and December.
Why Tesla Needed This Move
After a strong third quarter — fueled by buyers rushing to secure the now-expired $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit — Tesla faces a much tougher market. EV sales growth is slowing, and competitors in China and Europe are churning out cheaper models with increasingly competitive tech.
By launching “standard” variants, Tesla aims to make its vehicles more accessible and offset declining sales from its aging lineup. However, the strategy also underscores the company’s pivot away from its long-promised $25,000 EV, once dubbed the “Model 2.” That project was abruptly canceled last year.
Not That Affordable
For budget-conscious buyers, these new trims might make Tesla cars a little more attractive. But there’s a catch—while the cars are cheaper, are they really that cheap? We don’t think so. At nearly $40,000, they still cost significantly more than quite a few all-electric and hybrid alternatives.
Tesla’s new “affordable” models offer a welcome price break and could give sales a short-term boost. But without a true low-cost EV in the pipeline, the company risks losing ground in the mass market it once dominated.
Tesla has indeed made its cars less expensive—but not necessarily affordable enough to win over mainstream buyers.
Also, cheaper versions of existing models could affect sales of higher-margin vehicles. In the longer term, these price cuts will not directly address the real threat from Chinese EV makers, who are flooding global markets with sub-$30,000 electric cars packed with features."

Here's what you need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Rise After S&P 500 Breaks Seven-Session Win Streak
Stock futures pointed are pointing higher after major indexes slipped yesterday. Futures tied the the benchmark S&P 500 index, which had a seven-session winning streak snapped yesterday, were up 0.2% recently, as were futures linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.3%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects a variety of consumer loans, was at 4.10%, down from 4.13% yesterday afternoon.
2. Gold Hits Another All-Time High
Gold futures were trading at more than $4,050 an ounce as investors continue to push the price of the yellow metal to all-time highs. Blowout demand for the traditional safe haven has partially been driven by the “debasement trade,” which refers to investors buying gold as a hedge against a ballooning federal debt, threats to the Federal Reserve’s independence, and the weakness of the U.S. dollar. The same trade also helped send the price of bitcoin (BTCUSD) to record levels above $125,000 earlier this week, though the cryptocurrency has retreated recently from those highs and was trading at around $122,900 this morning.
3. FOMC Minutes To Provide Clues About Fed's Thinking on Path of Interest Rates
Investors will be watching the 2 p.m. ET release of the minutes of the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in 2025. The meeting minutes will offer details on the FOMC's deliberations, providing insights into how committee members view the outlook for the economy and interest rates. One member of the committee—newly-installed Fed Governor Stephen Miran—argued that the central bank should have moved to make an even steeper cut to rates in September. The Fed’s report comes as the federal government shutdown enters its second week, delaying the release of several economic reports, including last week’s jobs report. The Federal Reserve is funded through interest charged on its investments, not congressional funding, allowing it to remain open during the shutdown.
4. Tesla Shares Tick Higher After Falling on Low-Price-Vehicle Announcement
Tesla (TSLA) shares are slightly higher in premarket trading after dropping yesterday as investors appeared disappointed in its announcement to sell a cheaper version of its electric vehicle. The company on Tuesday afternoon unveiled cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, priced around $35,000 and $38,000, respectively. Investors anticipated the event but may have been expecting an even better price point. Tesla watchers have for years awaited lower-priced vehicles; some may still be hoping for a new, more affordable model, rather than lower prices on existing ones. Shares of Tesla were up 0.5% recently, after sliding more than 4% yesterday.
5. AI Software Maker Confluent Surges on Report of Potential Sale
Shares of Confluent (CFLT) were up nearly 20% in premarket trading following a report that the software provider is exploring a sale amid interest in its ability to support AI development. Reuters reported that the data infrastructure company was working with an investment bank on the sales process, as private equity firms and other suitors have expressed interest in Confluent’s technology.

Oct. 8 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell about 4.5% on Tuesday after the company introduced cheaper versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan in the U.S.
The new variants, priced at $39,990 for the Model Y and $36,990 for the Model 3, are roughly $5,000 less than the existing models. Analysts said the limited price cut may not be enough to revive demand following the loss of a key federal tax credit for electric vehicles at the end of September.
Tesla, which has faced increasing competition from Chinese automakers and slower U.S. EV adoption, has struggled to maintain sales momentum. The company reported a 12% decline in second-quarter revenue to $22.4 billion, marking its steepest drop in more than a decade, after deliveries fell 14%.
CEO Elon Musk had earlier shifted focus from a promised budget EV to projects in robotics and autonomous driving, leaving Tesla's core vehicle business under renewed scrutiny.
The company's last major launch, the Cybertruck, has seen tepid U.S. sales of about 52,000 units since 2023, according to Cox Automotive data.
Analysts noted that the new lower-priced cars are aimed at offsetting subsidy losses but could struggle to lift margins amid rising competition."

finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-08T10:36:11,The most popular stocks and funds investors bought in September,"Major stock markets continued to climb in September, despite lingering concerns around geopolitics, tariffs and the economy.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1cded81177fb598eed2ef393574585b36d2b589808eafdeee829e8fef68e917e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-popular-stocks-funds-investors-uk-september-103611811.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-popular-stocks-funds-investors-uk-september-103611811.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/most-popular-stocks-funds-investors-uk-september-103611811.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Major stock markets continued to climb in September, despite lingering concerns around geopolitics, tariffs and the economy.
September capped off another eventful quarter for investors, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 14.5% year-to-date and the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained 16% in that time, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) advanced 13%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) is up more than 34% so far this year, while Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) has risen more than 20%.
Zara Nokes, global market analyst at JPMorgan Asset Management (JPM), said: ""The third quarter of 2025 saw positive returns across most major asset classes as trade tensions subsided, AI euphoria continued, and expectations for near-term rate cuts from the Federal Reserve ... ramped up.""
She said that growth-style stocks outperformed their value peers ""as excitement around the tech sector ratcheted higher"". Regionally, Nokes pointed out that emerging market stocks outperformed those in developed markets, led by the Chinese market, ""buoyed by the extension of the US-China trade truce and AI optimism"".
Another major focus for investors last month was the Fed's September meeting, after which the US central back announced a 0.25% interest rate cut. This lowered its benchmark interest rate to a range of 4% to 4.25% and was the Fed's first cut of 2025.
September also marked US president Donald Trump's state visit to the UK, during which £250bn of investment was pledged between companies from both countries.
As the month drew to a close, speculation ramped up in the UK as to what chancellor Rachel Reeves could announce in the autumn budget, following interviews and her speech at the Labour party conference.
Most popular stocks in September
Major FTSE 100 (^FTSE) companies were popular across each of AJ Bell (AJB.L), Bestinvest and Interactive Investor's lists last month.
This ranged from companies in the financial sector, to mining and housebuilding stocks.
Here's more detail on some of the stocks that proved most popular in August, according to investment platform data.
Financial services firm Legal & General (LGEN.L) featured across each of AJ Bell (AJB.L), Bestinvest and Interactive Investor's most popular stocks lists in September.
Shares in L&G are trading just over 3% year-to-date, with the stock having fallen sharply in late August, suggesting investors were keen to buy the dip.
That's despite the company reporting 9% growth in its core operating earnings per share (EPS) at 10.94p for the first half of the year. In its first half results, published in August, L&G posted a 28% rise in pre-tax profit to £406m
At the time, L&G CEO António Simões flagged that the company's operating profit for its institutional retirement business was up double digits, along with ""material progress"" in the firm's asset management business.
Another name that featured across all three platforms' lists was aero-engineer Rolls-Royce (RR.L), as government pledges to spend more on defence have buoyed stocks with exposure to the sector this year.
Shares ended the month on a fresh high, with the stock up 104% since the start of 2025.
Rolls-Royce shares rallied after the company posted strong half-year results at the end of July. The company reported an underlying operating profit of £1.76bn ($2.38bn) in the first half of the year, compared to £1.15bn a year ago. Underlying revenue of £9.06bn was also up on the £8.18bn Rolls-Royce reported in the first half of last year.
Insurance firm Phoenix Group (PHNX.L) was another popular UK blue-chip stock across all three platforms in September.
Shares are up more than 30% year-to-date, despite the stock falling following the release of the company's interim results early last month.
Phoenix reported a 25% increase in adjusted operating profit to £451m, while loss after shrunk 76% to £156m in the first six months of its fiscal year.
In addition, the company said it rebranding from Phoenix Group Holdings to Standard Life in March 2026.
Oil major BP (BP.L) appeared on both AJ Bell and Bestinvest's stock lists in September, with shares currently up nearly 10% so far this year.
That's despite continued volatility in oil prices, as developments in geopolitical conflicts drive the commodity higher, while concerns about oversupply and declining demand have led to a longer-term decline.
Like fellow FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) oil major Shell, which also featured on AJ Bell's list, one appeal of BP to investors is its dividend yield, which sits at 5.6%, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.
In terms of US stocks, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) remained one of the most popular stocks for investors using the Bestinvest and Interactive Investor platforms.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said that the company's shares ""enjoyed another strong month, despite growing concerns about the dizzy heights reached by valuations in the sector"".
Nvidia shares are trading more than 38% in the green year-to-date, buoyed by investor enthusiasm for AI.
In addition to announcing investment in the UK, during Trump's state visit, Nvidia (NVDA) also unveiled $100bn investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.
The most popular funds in September
Passive exposure to the world's largest companies, including the major tech firms, continued to be a key theme in August's most popular funds list.
Kyle Caldwell, funds and investment education editor at Interactive Investor, said that a key trend on the platform's September most bought funds list was increased demand for precious metals.
The iShares Physical Gold (SGLN.L) exchange traded commodity (ETC) jumped to the top of Interactive Investor's list last month, while iShares Physical Silver (SSLN.L) also appeared on the list.
""As well as geopolitical tensions and concerns over US tariffs leading investors to seek out safe-haven assets, other drivers of both gold and silver include weakness in the US dollar, higher government debts, and fears that inflation will remain sticky,"" Caldwell said.
""For gold, another element has been high amounts of central bank buying to diversify away from fiat currencies and US government bonds.""
Due to its wider industrial use, Caldwell said silver prices have had a bumpier ride over the long-term than gold, meaning it has greater cyclical characteristics.
In terms of active funds, Artemis Global Income (0P0000W36K.L) once again featured on each of the platform's lists. The fund aims to grow both income and capital over a five-year period, having generated a return of 158.9% over that time and has a historic yield of 2.63%.
Over one year, the fund has generated a return of 39%, beating an average return of 9.3% for the Investment Association Global Equity Income fund sector.
Top holdings include real estate investment trust Simon Property Group (SPG) and energy company Chevron (CVX)."

(Reuters) -Tesla's (TSLA) lower-priced versions of its staple Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan face an uphill battle in the region where Elon Musk's company arguably needs help the most: Europe.
Unveiled on Tuesday, the $39,990 Model Y Standard and $36,990 Model 3 will join a European market already crowded with budget EVs, with European and Chinese brands offering more than a dozen models below $30,000 - and more to come.
That's in contrast to the United States, where only one EV, the Nissan Leaf, falls into that price range.
""The competition in this market is fierce,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions, adding the array of EVs in Europe priced below Tesla's cheaper Model Y and Model 3 could hamper their prospects.
LESS COMPETITION IN US, BUT LESS OPPORTUNITY
Tesla, which argues that its sometimes higher prices are justified by superior quality and features, has suffered an almost halving in its European market share to about 1.5% since 2023, when the Model Y was the region's best-selling car.
Analysts attribute the decline partly to an ageing product lineup and to a backlash by some consumers against Musk for his support of far-right politicians.
Tesla hopes the cheaper cars will revive sales after global deliveries fell in 2024 for the first time and are forecast to drop another 10% this year, according to Visible Alpha estimates.
In the United States, the Model Y Standard's sub-$40,000 price tag will match or undercut rivals including Hyundai Motor's Ioniq 5 SUV, General Motors' (GM) Chevrolet Blazer, and Volkswagen's (VWAGY) ID.4.
Still, the U.S. EV market is expected to contract in coming quarters following the September 30 expiry of a longstanding $7,500 tax credit for buyers. Even if Tesla's cheaper cars can claw back some market share, Musk has said it could face a ""few rough quarters"" if overall U.S. demand stalls, as expected.
In China, Tesla's new releases remain significantly more expensive than domestic rivals such as BYD Co's Yuan Plus and SAIC-GM-Wuling's mini EVs, which dominate the world's biggest EV market.
DOZENS OF EVS DESCEND ON EUROPEAN SHOWROOMS
In Europe, Tesla is up against many cheaper rivals, including the BYD Dolphin Surf that starts at 23,000 euros ($26,830), the Dacia Spring at 16,800 euros and the Citroen e-C3 SUV at 23,300 euros. And more are coming.
Last month, Volkswagen said it planned an ID.Polo compact hatchback EV for under 25,000 euros next year.
However, Pedro Pacheco, vice president of research at consultancy Gartner, said the Model Y Standard would probably be cheaper than BYD's best-selling Seal plug-in hybrid SUV."

Economic data releases and earnings
Tesla has an answer to the end of electric vehicle tax credits and slowing sales: slightly cheaper EVs.
The electric automaker unveiled lower-cost versions of its bestselling SUV and sedan on Tuesday, in an event whose teaser ginned up more excitement than the double feature. Wall Street appeared to like the announcement (+5%) more before people learned what it was (-4%).
Tesla is a (cheaper) car company again. And while more competitive prices may goose vehicle purchases, the late turn toward affordability is a curious choice when Elon Musk's company is supposed to be on the verge of a grand AI transition.
This is like a tech giant celebrating its discounted smart speaker just before the hyped release of a superintelligence app. Why invest in a lesser version of a VCR when your best people are busy building a streaming service?
Sure, there is a business case to offer products at lower price points, especially now, to make up for the disappearance of the $7,500 EV subsidy from the government. And with that math essentially canceling itself out, we are back to a slightly less premium car for the same amount of money. Call it ""car price shrinkflation.""
But it looks odd, or perhaps even ominous, to tweak what will soon be outdated technology and product lines when you are also heralding a world-changing event. My ""Tesla is not a car company"" T-shirt has people asking a lot of questions already answered by my shirt.
To be clear, this wasn't a complete surprise. Musk and company said earlier this year a cheaper Model Y was coming. And Tesla watchers expected an announcement to drop after the expiration of tax subsidies. That makes financial sense.
But there are still reasons why this update should spark skepticism toward Tesla's AI undertaking.
First, this is a watered-down version of the more ambitious plan to mass-produce a mainstream, $25,000 electric vehicle. (Both stripped-down variants start close to $40,000. Model 2, R.I.P.). Second, even this scaled-back initiative is arriving later than expected (Tardiness is part of Tesla's charm). And most importantly, the release of more affordable but inferior products from Tesla's aging lineup provides the latest and starkest contrast between what Musk delivers and what he promises.
The ultra-capable humanoid robots are on the way. An on-demand fleet of autonomous cars is just around the corner. Tesla is an AI and robotics company, and its backers value it as one. In the meantime, are you interested in buying an objectively worse car?"

Each year, the firm releases a new edition of its ""Big Ideas"" report, and the 2025 version discusses how autonomous vehicles could turn ride-hailing into a $10 trillion industry over the long term.
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is a leading developer of autonomous technologies. Its new Cybercab robotaxi is scheduled to enter mass production next year, and CEO Elon Musk wants to create a ride-hailing network to autonomously haul passengers around the clock.
However, Tesla might be behind the curve. Uber Technologies (UBER 0.35%) operates the world's largest ride-hailing network, and it has partnered with at least 20 companies developing autonomous vehicles and delivery robots. Some of them are already completing thousands of paid trips every day.
If you're looking to invest in the autonomous revolution, here's why Uber stock looks like a much better buy than Tesla right now.
Tesla will struggle to match Uber's scale
Building a capable self-driving car is only a small part of capturing the autonomous ride-hailing opportunity. Customers won't use a network that doesn't supply a ride in a timely fashion whenever they pull out their smartphone, no matter how good the car is. Uber has perfected the customer experience, which is why 180 million people use its platform every month.
In an August conference call with investors, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi talked about how the company already has the infrastructure in place to succeed in the autonomous era. It has 15 years of experience managing utilization in the world's major cities, which is the secret to running a profitable operation.
For example, if a company doesn't deploy enough cars, it can't provide a convenient user experience. But if it supplies too many cars, 95% of them might sit idle during quiet periods, destroying profit margins.
Therefore, it's no surprise 20 different companies in the autonomous space have partnered with Uber, and that number is growing. One of them is Alphabet's Waymo, which already completes over 250,000 paid autonomous trips every single week across five U.S. cities. It uses a combination of its own network and Uber's network in some cities, but it exclusively uses Uber in Austin and Atlanta.
In July, Uber also partnered with China-based Baidu. It owns the Apollo Go robotaxi service, which has completed over 14 million autonomous trips in China and the Middle East. Therefore, this deal could accelerate Uber's presence in these markets. Uber recently also signed a deal to deploy 20,000 of Lucid's upcoming autonomous electric vehicles over the next six years, which are being developed in partnership with Nuro AI.
Tesla will struggle to compete with the growing number of autonomous brands attaching themselves to Uber's network. The company's full self-driving software isn't even approved for unsupervised use anywhere in the U.S. yet, which could be a roadblock for the Cybercab next year. Moreover, it has to build an entire ride-hailing network from scratch, with no guarantee consumers will adopt it.
Uber stock looks like a bargain relative to Tesla
Autonomous vehicles could transform Uber's unit economics. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), the company paid a whopping $20.8 billion to its 8.8 million human drivers, which was the single biggest component of its $46.7 billion in gross bookings (the dollar amount customers spent on the platform). If autonomous vehicles can reduce or eliminate that cost, more of Uber's bookings will convert into revenue.
On that note, based on Uber's trailing-12-month revenue of $47.3 billion, its stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 4.3, which is a staggering 73% discount to Tesla's P/S ratio of 16.3 (at the time of this writing).
Uber grew its revenue by 16% during the first half of 2025; whereas, Tesla's revenue shrank by 12%, which makes the valuation gap very difficult to justify.
Tesla stock also trades at a sky-high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 248, so it's seven times more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 index, which has a P/E ratio of 33.4. It's hard to make the case for buying Tesla stock at the current level, independent of anything Uber is doing.
If Ark Invest is right about autonomous ride-hailing becoming a $10 trillion market, it appears Uber is better positioned to capture the opportunity than Tesla as things currently stand. Then, once you factor in the valuation issue, Uber stock also looks like the no-brainer choice for investors who want to own a slice of this new industry."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-08T09:45:00,3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready for a Bull Run,These companies have disappointed so far in 2025 but have bright futures.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=980567bbc40e167737554bd66fccbabd723ed205bae8dec6cae6ee2a9081baee,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/3-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-ready-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/3-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-ready-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/3-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-ready-for/,fool.com,200,,"For investors, artificial intelligence (AI) is the gift that keeps on giving. AI stocks have helped the market jump 14% so far this year -- an extraordinary achievement when you consider that it has battled a shaky economy, tariffs, and high interest rates all year.
And that gravy train will keep going. Grand View Research reports that the AI market was worth $270.22 billion in 2024 and should reach $3.5 trillion by 2033 for a compound annual growth rate of 31.5%. So, if you want to continue to beat the market for the next several years, you need to be looking closely at AI stocks.
There have been many big winners so far, such as Nvidia, Palantir Technologies, and CoreWeave, that have all enjoyed monster gains this year. If you're looking for some great AI names that haven't caught fire yet, then I recommend considering Tesla (TSLA 1.39%), Salesforce (CRM -1.34%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.45%). I think all three are ripe for a bull run.
1. Tesla
Tesla is one of the world's best-known automakers and a true innovator in electric vehicles, battery charging, and autonomous vehicles. But the stock hasn't been a winner so far this year, underperforming the market with only a 6% year-to-date gain.
Tesla has been hampered by a lot of backlash. CEO Elon Musk took a central role in the U.S. presidential election and in setting up the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and he campaigned for a far-right party in German elections. Whether you agree or disagree with Musk's political leanings, it's clear that mixing politics with a publicly traded company comes with risk.
But on the plus side, Tesla is gearing up for a huge quarter. The company announced that it delivered more than 497,000 vehicles in the quarter, a record for the company. A federal tax credit of $7,500 expired at the end of the quarter, likely encouraging buyers to make their purchases before Oct. 1.
Tesla is also working to ramp up its Robotaxi autonomous service with its Model Y vehicles. The Robotaxi service is currently available only in Austin, Texas, but Musk has ambitions to offer it nationally. Self-driving taxis could be a huge tailwind for Tesla stock in the future; Cathie Wood from Ark Invest believes that it could comprise 90% of the company's enterprise value by 2030.
2. Salesforce
Salesforce is a software-as-a-service company that's turning to AI to juice its revenue. The company's Agentforce tool is available to help more than a dozen industries, including financial services, retail, technology, manufacturing, construction, and more.
Salesforce operates customer relationship management software in the cloud. It allows users to see sales, marketing, customer service, and e-commerce tools in an easy-to-use platform that's accessible anywhere. And it says its Agentforce tool helps businesses maximize their autonomous AI agents 16 times faster than traditional approaches.
The company saw revenue of $10.2 billion in the second quarter, up 10% from a year ago, and its data cloud and AI annual recurring revenue was up 120% from a year ago.
The continuing adaption of Agentforce (the company says it's closed 12,000 deals since launching the tool) encouraged management to increase third-quarter and full-year guidance. Salesforce stock is down about 35% on the year, but numbers like this should help push it higher.
3. Amazon
Amazon is a heavy hitter with AI, both in its huge e-commerce division and the fast-growing Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company has more than 1 million robots working in its warehouses and fulfillment centers to help streamline deliveries.
And AWS is increasingly in demand as companies roll out their own AI-powered platforms and need data centers with the computing power to make them work. AWS is the global leader in cloud computing, with a 30% market share.
That segment is smaller than the company's e-commerce network, but it's perhaps more important to its success. Amazon.com sales were $136.8 billion in the second quarter, but because e-commerce has low profit margins, the company earned only $9 billion in profit. Meanwhile, AWS generated $30.8 billion in revenue and a cool $10.1 billion in profit.
The weak margins in e-commerce, combined with international trade challenges this year, have contributed to push Amazon stock lower, and it is roughly flat for the year. But as AWS continues to grow and fuel profits, this AI stock should find its footing.

Good morning. If it seems like more CEOs are asking for—and getting—so-called “moonshot” pay packages, well, they are, as I reported in a recent feature for Fortune. A moonshot ties CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible targets over five to 10 years. The upshot is often billions in compensation and slices of company ownership. But in the meantime, the CEO gets almost nothing.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has hit two moonshots, but the second award, once valued at $56 billion, was twice rescinded after a legal challenge. Taser stun gun and body camera company Axon Enterprise awarded its CEO Rick Smith a carbon copy of Musk’s deal in 2018 at a smaller magnitude. Smith blew the lights out and last year earned compensation valued at $165 million after growing the company’s market cap from $2.5 billion to $13.5 billion. Smith even brought his entire workforce along with him by sharing some of his pay with employees, negotiating a deal where $88 million in stock went to the lowest-paid workers at Axon. His moonshot is also open to Axon workers, allowing them to put some of their pay at risk in a way similar to Smith’s comp. He’s now on a second seven-year moonshot plan, but even Smith’s wife was against the notion at first, because she thought it was just too risky.
Now, the trend is poised to spread beyond founder-CEOs like Smith to what Todd Sirras of executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy calls “founder-anointed successors.” For instance, Opendoor Technologies CEO Kaz Nejatian got a potential $2.8 billion moonshot and a slice of the company after he was hired last month. But Sirras’ concern is that big bets on a single CEO pose major risks to shareholders. Human beings are emotional and they get distracted easily thinking about what they can buy with all this stock, he said, like a new private jet.
He compared the potential rise of moonshot pay deals to the Jurassic Park film series. “Danger increases exponentially the closer these awards get to the general executive population,” Sirras said. While moonshots for founder-annointed successors and non-successors with a major capital investment he deems “inside the T-Rex fence”—“awards in non-founder companies means the dinosaurs have escaped and are heading to the mainland.” Read the full article here.—Amanda Gerut"

Shares in Tesla closed Tuesday's session 4.5% in the red, after the EV maker unveiled its cheaper versions of its Model Y and Model 3 cars.
The new Model Y Standard is rear-wheel drive and will start at $39,990 (£29,808), while the Model 3 Standard comes in at $36,990.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tesla's announcement ""landed with a dull thud for those dreaming of a game-changing new model"".
He said that the cheaper ""standard"" models were ""achieved by stripping out premium features like glass roofs, rear screens, and some creature comforts – but this is cost-cutting, not reinvention"".

""For investors looking for fireworks, this wasn’t it. But for those watching the autonomy story, yesterday was another important step toward the future Tesla is betting on.""

On the London market, gold producer Endeavour Mining (EDV.L) was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Wednesday morning, with its shares up 2.6%.
The rise came as the gold price (GC=F) surged to fresh highs, soaring past the $4,000 per ounce mark. Investors have been flocking to the precious metal, as it is considered to act as a safe haven amid uncertainties such as the government shutdown in the US.
Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets, said: ""Inflation, soaring debt, government spending ... time to party like it’s like the 1970s.

NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) -A race by crypto companies to sell tokens pegged to stocks is raising alarm bells among traditional financial firms and regulatory experts who warn that the fast-growing novel products pose risks to investors and market stability.
Buoyed by President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance and his administration's push for friendly regulations, the crypto industry is rushing to capitalize on a global surge in enthusiasm for the sector.
Robinhood, Gemini and Kraken among others have launched tokenized stocks in Europe, while Coinbase, Robinhood and startup Dinari are seeking approval to launch similar products in the United States. Nasdaq, meanwhile, last month became the first major exchange to propose offering tokenized shares.
The industry says tokenized shares — blockchain-based instruments that track traditional equities — could revolutionize stock markets by allowing shares to be traded 24/7 and settled instantly, boosting liquidity and reducing transaction costs. The combined value of tokenized public stocks geared toward retail investors as of September grew to $412 million, compared with just a few million dollars 12 months ago, according to tokenization tracker RWA.xyz.
Although many products are marketed like stocks, they rarely offer the same rights, disclosures and protections as traditional equities. Instead, they more closely resemble riskier derivatives, according to a Reuters review of several products and interviews with a dozen industry executives and legal experts. That increases the hazards for investors, while tokenization more broadly could undermine market integrity and fragment liquidity if left unsupervised, critics say.
""You're buying exposures to those shares through creating some sort of synthetic instrument,"" said Diego Ballon Ossio, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in London. ""A lot of the burden gets shifted on you to understand what exactly it is that you're buying.""
A few companies have issued their own experimental stock tokens on the blockchain - software that acts as a shared digital ledger - but most tokenized shares are pegged to public companies and issued by third parties like Ondo Global Markets and Dinari. Some tokens are backed 1:1 by underlying stocks, while others provide economic exposure through derivatives.
The industry is divided over which regulations apply to stock tokens, and investor rights and protections vary. Often, the products provide no ownership, voting rights or traditional dividends, while creating counterparty risk exposure to the token issuer."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-08T00:20:00,Does Tesla's Surprise Delivery Surge Mean Its Sales Slump Is Over?,The electric vehicle maker's sales unexpectedly jumped in September. Is this a turning point?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d98c334369b4975845644e1bd99679fbfb822a1854394e952134ad2d178c571a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/does-teslas-surprise-delivery-surge-mean-its-sales/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/does-teslas-surprise-delivery-surge-mean-its-sales/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/does-teslas-surprise-delivery-surge-mean-its-sales/,fool.com,200,,"Back in April, the unthinkable happened.
Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) -- the world's largest car company by market cap, the biggest global manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), and the maker of the best-selling automobile on Earth in 2023 and 2024 -- posted a year-over-year quarterly delivery decline. Then in July, it happened again.
So investors were bracing for another quarter of shrinking sales when Tesla released its Q3 delivery numbers this month, but instead, the automaker blew expectations out of the water, reporting record-high deliveries of 497,099 vehicles, up 7.4% over the prior year.
So, do these record sales numbers mark a turning point for Tesla and its controversial CEO, Elon Musk? Let's not read too much into this. Here's what's really going on.
Beating the clock
Although Tesla is a global brand, the U.S. is its largest market, responsible for about 40% of its sales in 2024. And there was a huge incentive to buy a Tesla in the U.S. in the third quarter: The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" eliminated the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as of October. That likely pulled a lot of purchases forward from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. After all, if you know you want to buy a Tesla this year, why would you give up a huge discount by waiting until October, November, or December?
This explanation for the surge in Tesla's Q3 deliveries tracks with data from other U.S. automakers. General Motors (GM 1.26%), Ford (F 0.86%), and Stellantis (STLA 1.97%) all reported higher sales in the third quarter, largely driven by huge increases in electric vehicle sales. Ford, for example, reported an 8.2% increase in overall vehicle sales, but a much sharper increase of 19.8% in electric vehicle sales (including hybrids), led by a 39.7% increase in F-150 Lightning sales and a jaw-dropping 50.7% increase in Mustang Mach-E sales. At GM, the results were even stronger, with total Q3 vehicle sales up 8% year-over-year, but EV sales surging by 107%.
The record-breaking EV sales numbers from Tesla's rivals put its comparatively puny 7.4% sales increase in perspective.
Sales in Europe look shaky
Tesla's U.S. sales probably surged more than 7.4% in Q3, but were offset by sales declines in its other major markets like China (which accounted for about 30% of 2024 sales) and Europe (about 20% of 2024 sales). While Tesla doesn't release a breakdown of its sales by country, several European markets keep track of new Tesla registrations, which are considered a proxy for its new vehicle sales.
And, boy, do those numbers look bleak. Even though September sales were up 20.5% year over year in Denmark, for example, and 14.7% in Norway, those countries combined represented only about 2% of all Tesla sales worldwide in 2024. Elsewhere, even the bright spots weren't so bright: In September, Tesla sales rose 3.4% in Spain (also 0.9% of 2024 sales), 2.7% in France (2% of 2024 sales), and were flat in the U.K. (which at 3% of 2024 sales is Tesla's biggest European market).
Perhaps Sweden gives us the clearest picture of Tesla's European market woes, though. It only sold 210 vehicles in Sweden in August. In response, the company rolled out new sales incentives for September, including zero-interest financing and a trade-in bonus of about $4,200 per vehicle. Swedish September sales then ""surged"" by 721% month over month to about 1,700 vehicles, but that was still a year-over-year drop of 65% (!) compared with the 4,792 vehicles it sold in September 2024.
Brace yourself for... not much
These numbers show that Tesla's business hasn't turned a corner. If anything, it's primed for a steeper-than-ever sales decline in the fourth quarter. The federal $7,500 tax credit is no longer supporting U.S. sales, European sales are collapsing despite huge sales incentives, and the company will face a tough comparison to Q4 2024, which represented a then-record for Tesla deliveries.
Even so, the slumping sales seem unlikely to have a major effect on Tesla's stock price. The shares have declined by only single-digit percentages since the Q3 numbers came out, and the stock is still up by more than 6% year-to-date:
If recent sales declines and a bleak outlook for future sales haven't dealt major damage to Tesla's lofty share price, it's unlikely that further sales declines will have any major impact on its valuation, which is now more tied to the company's vision for autonomous Robotaxis and humanoid robots than to its electric vehicle sales."

VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo sits down with Josh Lipton to talk more about the data and affordability issues in auto loans.
To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.
Well, a new report from Vantage score shows a troubling trend in the auto loan market. Delinquencies are climbing more than 50% since 2010, and it's not just from risky borrowers. For more, we're bringing in Ricardo Bandabo, chief economist at Vantage score. Ricardo, it is good to see you. Let's start off with auto loans because you were breaking down that data and it was an interesting report. What you say now, correct me if I have this wrong, but you call it the riskiest credit product now? What what is going on there? What are the trends? Walk us through it.
So, what we saw was that in Q1 of this year, actually auto loans became the riskiest consumer credit product. Um and that has been something that has been evolving over some time. Um so what we did is we actually because this is a question we get asked by lenders and economists all the time. What's going on with these auto loans and the delinquencies? So, we went back and looked at the data going all the way back to the end of the last recession. And what we see is that actually, going back to the first quarter of 2010, at that point, auto loans were actually the least risky of all consumer loan products. And then and now, this year, we now hit the point where it's the most risky one. And during that time period, what we saw was that every other loan category actually has seen their delinquency rates go down from the first quarter of 2010. whilst at the same time, auto loans have gone up over 50%.
Is that, Now, what are the reasons for that? Is that affordability? Is that people are are they biting off more than they can chew? What are the variables?
Yeah, so we did a big study. We we pulled in our data, we pulled in data from the government data and big did a big regression analysis. And what we found was that there are really two themes that are driving this. First one is very much as you insinuated, is the affordability, right? So, um as we look at for instance average loan sizes, we've actually seen that in this period of 15 years, the average auto loan has gone up faster than any other product, including mortgage, right? It's gone up 57%. So, on top of that, in terms of affordability, more recently, we've seen interest rates go up. So that's kind of a double whammy on the on your monthly outlay, right for your auto loan. Not only has the principle gone up, but the interest payment has significantly gone up as well. And given that auto loans are typically one of the second or third biggest outlay in an average household on a monthly basis, that's a pretty big hit for many consumers.
Who when we talk what are the consumers that are, Ricardo, most vulnerable when we talk about auto delinquencies?
So, like always, you tend to see that obviously subprime consumers have higher delinquency rates than others. Um but what the interesting trend that we're seeing here is that a couple years ago, as these auto loans started to rise more quickly, a lot of auto lenders adjusted their lending criteria. But that didn't stop the delinquencies increasing. What we saw was that, yes, we saw that um subprime auto loans actually reduced in risk. We saw less delinquencies from subprime based on their changes. But at the same time, we saw the amount of delinquencies coming from near prime and prime consumers going up quite a bit. So, it's not necessarily then the the answer that most people expect that it's subprime. It seems to be that their challenges with those people that are actually from higher income households and have had traditionally better credit health."

Intended to help Tesla reach a broader customer base and shed its reputation as a company that caters only to the wealthy, the new models are still not affordable enough and unlikely to trigger a buying spree, analysts said.
The new models come just after the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles, which is expected to strangle growth at EV makers this month and going forward.
Tesla unveiled the vehicles on Tuesday on Chief Executive Elon Musk's social media site, X. The Model 3 Standard has a starting price of $36,990, just $5,500 less expensive than the existing version of the Model 3. The Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, $5,000 less than its pricier counterpart.

Tesla previously had plans to release a vehicle priced at less than $30,000 that never came to fruition. The new models may boost sales, said Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives, but they don't represent a drastic enough change.
Cheaper models ""will be important to stimulate demand with the EV tax credit expiring,"" Ives wrote in a note Tuesday. ""But we are relatively disappointed with this launch as the price point is only $5,000 lower.""
The EV leader has long teased the idea of making more affordable vehicles to allow people with lower incomes to go green. The price cuts for stripped-down versions of the models fail even to offset the loss of the federal tax credit.
On price, Tesla faces significant competition. A handful of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are on the market for $35,000 or less, even as auto tariffs threaten to raise the cost of cars and parts.
The Hyundai Kona Electric and the Chevrolet Equinox EV both have starting prices between $32,000 and $34,000. The Nissan Leaf starts at $28,140.

Tesla's new Model 3 and Model Y vehicles will both have an all-electric range of 321 miles, about 40 miles less than the premium versions. The latest models are expected to hit the market before 2026.
Industry insiders say the company will need to do more than lower prices by less than 13% to gain back the market share it lost to competitors.
Tesla needs to repair the damage the brand took from Musk’s foray into politics, which rubbed many electric vehicle buyers the wrong way. It also needs to continue expanding its charging network and deliver on its self-driving technology."

Today's Featured Research Reports
Tesla’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past year (+85.4% vs. +72.9%). The company’s EV sales are feeling the heat from rising global competition. After recording its first-ever annual decline in deliveries in 2024, the slump has continued into 2025, with drops in both the first and second quarters.
Automotive margins are shrinking, and operating expenses are rising. Discouragingly, Musk expects the upcoming quarters to be rough. Still, there are a few bright spots. The Energy Generation & Storage unit remains a core strength, and the Supercharger network continues to expand.
Tesla has also launched its robotaxi service, though early reactions have been mixed. But the company believes that it holds significant cost and scalability advantages. If Tesla can deliver on its promises, this could be a major growth driver. Until then, caution is key.
(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)
Shares of UnitedHealth have underperformed the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (-37% vs. -31.3%). The company is facing persistent cost pressures, higher medical utilization, and an elevated debt burden threatening near-term margin stability. The Zacks analyst expects the MCR to increase to 89.4% in 2025. Its trimmed 2025 earnings outlook, coupled with a premium valuation and ongoing regulatory scrutiny, adds to investor caution.
Also, operations of Optum Rx will likely take a hit from the current administration's policies on PBMs. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. Nevertheless, UnitedHealth continues to benefit from balanced growth across both its segments, supported by rising healthcare demand and disciplined execution.
Consistent revenue gains, strong commercial enrollment and resilient cash flows highlight its scale advantage and diversified business mix. Optum’s expanding technology and value-based care operations further enhance long-term growth visibility.
(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)
Shopify’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+99.2% vs. +51%). The company prospect is benefiting from an expanding merchant base. New merchant-friendly tools like Shop Minis, Shop Cash, and Sign in with Shop along with Shop Pay solutions are helping SHOP win merchants regularly.
Shopify’s investment in AI-driven tools, such as Catalog, Universal Cart, and Sidekick, is helping merchants improve customer engagement and streamline operations. Shopify’s expanding international footprint with strong growth in Europe is a key catalyst. A rich partner base is helping SHOP expand its merchant base. Strong free cash flow margin reflects solid liquidity.
However, Shopify faces gross margin pressure due to higher hosting costs, the three-month paid trial program, and the expanded PayPal partnership, which carries lower margins. Higher operating expenses are expected to hurt operating profit.
(You can read the full research report on Shopify here >>>)
Shares of Waterstone Financial have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Savings and Loan industry over the past year (+14.9% vs. +10.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $285.60 million demonstrates earnings resilience with 35.2% YoY net income growth in Q2 2025, despite mortgage banking headwinds. Improved ROA (1.39%) and ROE (9.04%) highlight enhanced profitability, driven by cost discipline and operational efficiency.
The Community Banking segment delivered robust income growth via reduced compensation and occupancy costs, offsetting margin compression from deposit pricing. A sustained 15 cents dividend underscores capital strength and shareholder focus. Credit quality remains stable, with minimal provisioning needs and improved residential loan performance.
However, mortgage banking remains a drag with declining originations, shrinking margins and weak operating leverage. Persistent unrealized securities losses ($20.5 million) and rising CRE non-accruals introduce valuation and credit risks. Shares trade below peers at 0.83x P/B and 13.39x P/E.

Tesla looking to reignite car sales with a new initiative. Our senior auto reporter, Proz Subramanian joins us now with more Proz, what do we know so far about Tesla's latest announcement here?
Yeah, Josh, sort of it's finally here, right? These new cheaper EVs are here. So on Tesla's website they announced the Model Y standard. is a stripped down Model Y costing a little under $40,000. So what you got here is uh a a a less lighting in the front. You got rid of that full wrap on light bar in the front and rear. You have cloth seats inside uh you omitted the second screen in the back. Something decontent as they call to make the car a little bit cheaper. Uh so that'll go on sale in November, December. Also, they also announced kind of in a surprise the Model 3 standard as well. And that's going to be a shade under $37,000. So this is all, like you said, sort of here to address the concerns of Tesla's sales which were up quite a lot in Q3 because of the expiration of that federal tax credit. What happens in the fourth quarter is anyone's guess, but these two cheaper models are supposed to help boost sales.
All right, Proz, thank you. Appreciate it."

The two cars are now available for order on Tesla's US website. The Model Y Standard is rear-wheel drive, will start at $39,990, and has an estimated range of 321 miles with standard 18-inch wheels. The Model 3 Standard comes in even cheaper, at $36,990, and has the same range. While the Model Y Standard is available for November/December delivery, the Model 3 Standard arrives a little later, with a December/January delivery range.
Appearance-wise, the Standard trim omits the front and rear light bars on the Model Y and comes in only three colors: Stealth Grey, white, and Diamond Black. The only interior color available is black.
Tesla stock gained more than 5% on Monday after the EV maker posted gifs on Sunday of a spinning company logo with the date ""10/7"" and what appeared to be car headlights shining through smoke. Shares pulled back nearly 4% on Tuesday following the update to Tesla's website.
Inside, both Standard trims feature the same 15.4-inch infotainment screen as the more expensive models. However, there's no second-row screen, the ambient lighting has been removed, and cheaper cloth seating inserts surround vegan leather, per Tesla's website. Interestingly, Tesla removed the AM/FM radio tuners from the Standard trim, and the Standard models can only perform ""traffic aware cruise control,"" Tesla's version of adaptive cruise control, and are unable to perform ""autosteer"" functions like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD).
It is also likely that Tesla has wrung out costs from its batteries and electric motors to make the vehicles cheaper.
The Model Y and Model 3 Standard versions come after the federal EV tax credit expired in the US on Sept. 30. CEO Elon Musk said in the company's second quarter earnings call that the cheaper Model Y would come out after the tax credit expires.

Tesla said following Q2 earnings that the first builds of a more affordable model occurred in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025.
Tesla's release of these cheaper vehicles is expected to help grow volume for the automaker, which has seen sales dip in recent quarters, although Q3 sales jumped as buyers bought EVs ahead of the tax credit expiration.
Last quarter, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said he expected a pull forward of sales in Q3 because of the tax credit expiration, and the numbers back up that claim."

The new Standard Rear-Wheel Drive Model Y offers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, according to Tesla’s website. The Standard Model Y features several differences from higher-priced versions. The interior comes with textile decor and dual-tone seating that combines textile and vegan leather. It has a closed glass roof rather than the signature panoramic roof found in more expensive trims.
Other cost-saving modifications include manual-adjust steering wheel instead of power-adjust, LED headlights, manual-folding side-view mirrors, and auto high beams.
Over the weekend, Tesla had built up anticipation for its ""10/7"" announcement by posting two separate teaser videos on X. One video showed headlights emerging from darkness while another displayed what appeared to be a spinning wheel, followed by ""10/7"" reveal date.

Musk, who already runs Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), SpaceX, and Neuralink, has been plowing money into AI as the race heats up against Microsoft-backed (NASDAQ:MSFT) OpenAI, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META). All are spending billions building data centers and training new models.
xAI recently hit a $200 billion valuation, making it one of the most valuable startups in the world. But that growth is coming with a steep price tag Bloomberg reports the company is losing about $1 billion every month, mostly on computing and infrastructure costs.
The appointment gives Musk a seasoned finance hand at a time when both X and xAI need sharper discipline to match their massive ambitions."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) rolled out a new update to its driver assist technology, hours before a planned announcement that has stirred speculation about what's next for the electric vehicle maker.
Over the weekend, Tesla shared two short teaser videos on X. One showed a spinning Tesla logo with the date 10/7. Another showed the outline of a car's headlights.
The cryptic posts fueled talk that the company could unveil a lower-priced vehicle or provide long-awaited news on the next-generation Roadster.
Tesla's stock rose more than 5% Monday as the anticipation built. The company has not launched a new car since the Cybertruck in 2023, which drew wide attention but has faced several recalls and slower-than-expected sales."

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.
The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.
“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”
Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.
Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.
Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.
Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.
This model faces stiff competition in the $40,000 range for EVs from vehicles including Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet’s Equinox EV and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5.
The new Model 3 has also cut down on the driving range, ambient lighting and other features."

The company is now selling a more bare-bones version of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively.
The new versions, each dubbed “Standard,” get an estimated 321 miles of range on a full battery, and will come with fewer features than the more premium rear-wheel or all-wheel drive variants when they ship later this year. They don’t even have Autopilot, the company’s basic advanced driver assistance system. (The new models only come with traffic-aware cruise control; Autosteer, which completes the “Autopilot” feature-set, is missing.)
The release of the cheaper models is supposed to help push Tesla back into growth after it saw sales decline in 2024. But the pricing is not as low as some may have hoped, especially considering that CEO Elon Musk once teased the idea of a $25,000 Tesla — before he ultimately killed that project.
The new Model 3 does not even dip below the $35,000 price threshold that Tesla promoted in a run-up to the car’s launch in 2016. That sticker price, which helped put Tesla on the map, was never really offered save for a few months as an off-menu ordering option.
The new cars are more different on the inside than the outside. While Tesla’s cars are known for being minimalist, the Model 3 and Model Y Standard take the spartan approach to the limit. There’s no second-row touchscreen. The steering wheel and side mirrors are manually adjusted. There’s no FM/AM radio and just seven speakers compared to the 15 speakers and one subwoofer on the costlier versions. Only the first row has heated seats.
On the outside, Tesla ditched the light bar that adorns the nose of the more expensive Model Y variants. The glass roof is also gone on the Standard cars.
Musk and other Tesla executives have joked in the past, and at length, about playing “Game of Thrones but [for] pennies” — an effort to describe the company’s mad scramble to remove as much cost out of its cars as possible. That strip-it-down thinking appears to be the primary strategy of how the company approached the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.
Tesla plans to sell these versions in multiple global markets, including Europe. The expiration of the U.S. federal EV tax credit last month means these prices will be pretty straightforward in the United States, unless buyers live somewhere with strong state EV incentives.
That sets up an interesting calculus for new EV buyers. Major automakers are simultaneously pulling back plans for a number of more expensive electric vehicles, theoretically reducing competition, which could be a boon for Tesla."

(Reuters) -Tesla unveiled a more affordable version of its best-selling Model Y SUV on Tuesday starting at $39,990, as the electric-vehicle maker seeks to reverse falling sales and waning market share amid rising global competition.
Chief Executive Elon Musk has for years promised mass-market vehicles, though last year he canceled plans to build an all-new $25,000 EV, Reuters first reported.
Late last year, Musk said the vehicle would be priced below the ""key threshold"" of $30,000 including U.S. EV tax credits.
In the United States, prices effectively rose by $7,500 at the end of last month, when the credit ended. That helped goose quarterly sales to a record, but expectations are that they will slow down for the rest of the year, unless the affordable car comes to the rescue.
""The desire to buy the car is very high. (It's) just (that) people don't have enough money in the bank account to buy it,"" Musk said in July during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call. ""So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.""
Tesla had posted two clips on X over the weekend, igniting excitement among fans. One video shows headlights peering out of the dark and another shows what looks like a wheel spinning for a few seconds, followed by ""10/7"" — the U.S. format for the date October 7.
CRUCIAL TO $1 TRILLION PAY PLAN
Musk initially promised that production of the vehicle would start by the end of June. But Tesla only made what it called ""first builds"" of the car, it said in July, adding that it would be available for customers sometime in the last three months of the year.
Tesla has already been grappling with slowing sales of its aging lineup as competition has grown rapidly, especially in China and Europe, where Musk's far-right political views have also undermined brand loyalty.
Earlier this year, Tesla launched a refreshed version of the Model Y with improvements including new light bars and a rear touchscreen.
Musk has been pivoting the company toward artificial intelligence, focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla has said it will launch more affordable vehicles in its lineup but has not provided details.
Sources have told Reuters the EV maker also plans to roll out a stripped-down version of its Model 3 midsize sedan.
Affordable cars will also be key to Tesla delivering 20 million vehicles over the next decade - one of the several operational and valuation milestones set by the company's board as part of its proposed $1 trillion pay package for Musk.

Travis Hoium: Are smart glasses the future of technology hardware? Motley Fool Money starts down.
Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium joined by Lou Whiteman and Emily Flippen. We're going to jump right in today, and the big topic I thought for this week was Apple at least reportedly pulling back on their lighter Vision Pro headset. They're going to be moving in the same direction, it looks like as Meta has with their Ray Ban glasses, this AR technology. Emily, what are your thoughts on this whole space and where Meta and Apple fits into it?
Emily Flippen: I'm incredibly disappointed by Apple here. Look, Apple invested a lot of time and resources into convincing all of us that the future was in these lightweight, daily wearable glasses that were the visionary of spatial computing. Then a year later, just backtracks and it's not clear to me if this is, a desperate pull for them to say, no, me, too, when they see the innovation that Meta is doing and literally the metaverse, or if this is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. But in my opinion, I just am so incredibly bearish. Pivoting toward heavy duty VR glasses when it seems like we have years and years of evidence coming out of Meta that consumers just do not want this.
Travis Hoium: It seems like a space where they're throwing stuff at the wall, and we don't know exactly what's going to stick. But at least we know these lightweight things are going to stick a little bit. That seems like a little bit of the move in the right direction, Lou, but it's still it seems like this is a money losing proposition for the foreseeable future.
Lou Whiteman: We should say that this is one report, and we don't know what's going on, really. Apple has $65 billion in cash. I feel like they can do both. But look, the cynical take here is, I can't figure out to spin is Meta was right or Apple is really that desperate. Because in a way, this seems like it's validation of everything Meta is doing. In a way, it's Apple are they really just they need something? I agree with Emily. I see more potential in the Vision Pro. There's also more of a chance an outright flop. I don't get the obsession with glasses right now, and I'm worried to see everyone pushing in that direction.
Travis Hoium: One of the things that was interesting when the Vision Pro came out is look, I've been in the VR space for almost a decade now, and what was unique about it is it was almost like an AR pair of glasses while actually being VR. The pass through was better than we've ever had in any other device. It seemed like they were, even at that time, moving toward this AI future but the technology wasn't quite there yet. They hadn't miniaturized things enough to get to even where Meta and Ray Ban are with their current glasses. Maybe we were headed this direction all along, and like Lou said, they're walking and chewing gum at the same time. They're probably doing both of these things, but they're maybe now saying, hey, look, the Vision Pro has been a flop, and people are at least a little excited about these sunglasses or these glasses from Meta. Emily, is that maybe the right way to think about it? They're seeing what's gonna work and what's not, and they're seeing Meta's success. They have always been a follower. They're never usually the first company to release a device, so maybe that's the right strategy.
Emily Flippen: Yes, that's a really generous interpretation, I think, Travis. I think this is an issue. Really, I think it's an issue of bloat. I say that as somebody who is a fan of Apple. Ultimately, Apple is still a hardware business when push comes to shove. They have to be on the bleeding edge of whatever the new exciting hardware accessory is, even if that ends up getting commoditized, because otherwise, they could lose their position as one of the largest companies in the world. I understand the desperate need to be there. If Meta is onto something, Apple needs to be right there too. But here's the problem when you have so many extra billions of dollars in cash flow, is that it really does allow you to lack discipline where you choose to invest your CAPEX. I wish there was more focus coming out of the Apple Management team. Again, to your point, we don't exactly know how many resources are being put behind this larger version of these AR VR glasses. But I really do think that it's disappointing to see them spread out their attention when the Vision Pro hasn't lived up to its potential yet, and there is potential there. They might be a little early, but they invested more time and resources into convincing consumers about why this would be an addition to their everyday life. That can actually be onto something great. My concern is that when you do two things poorly, you do nothing well. I wish they would just focus on doing one thing well.
Lou Whiteman: Here's a question, and I don't know if this will end up being bullish or bearish, but, the Apple value proposition from the start was always, it just works. In a way that was tech for the normies. I'm a normie, so I appreciate that. I am yet to be convinced that the normies want these glasses, that there really is the market that they think there is. To me, I don't see it doing anything right now that you can't do on your phone, so it's an accessory to the phone, not a replacement. The watch is, too. The watch has done pretty well, but the watch is half the price of these. Do we want.
Travis Hoium: The watch is also nowhere near the market share that the iPhone.
Lou Whiteman: It is a niche product. Do we want an accessory that costs as much as the phone? I doubt it. The Glass Half Full is, Apple really sees a chance to do what they did with the iPhone relative to the Palm Pre and all those. They really have come up with something that is that next step. Glass Half Empty is that this is going to just be like the watch and be just another product out there that can't move the needle. When in theory, if they get the Vision Pro right over time, that could be a whole new product category. This is, again, what are we swinging for hits or swinging for home runs? Because this feels like going for a base hit and giving up on the home run swing.
Travis Hoium: I'll start with you, Lou, do you think the combination of artificial intelligence and these different form factors. Usually the technology revolutions, the disruption that happens, it comes with a new form factor. The mainframe, the PC, the smartphone, brought about all new winners, new business models. We've been talking about new form factors in AI for quite a while. The pendant didn't seem to stick. It seems like glasses has a chance. But then you run into this strange, I don't know if it's an uncanny valley where I can see some real value in, look, I can see in our recording, I can see your names. Sometimes I look down there when I'm reading the outro. I don't know why. I just do it. I'm meeting new parents as my kids go to school. I know I've met you before. I know you said your name, but I can't remember. If it just popped up on my glasses, that'd be great. On the flip side of that, if we're constantly recording everything all the time, that seems like a pretty dystopian vision of the future. It seems like we do need that killer app and we're just not there yet, and nobody's quite figured that out. Is that a fair critique of this next gen issue? It's almost like we're in the Apple Newton phase of the industry. We're 10 years too early.
Lou Whiteman: Let me give you a more subtle critique. Because I'm not going to go dystopian, although I see that, I see the fear. But look, we talk about what a distraction the phone is when you're driving, when you're walking down the street, whatever. Maybe, yes. If it just popped up Emily's name, if I couldn't think of it, that would be a help. But 90% of the things, be it directions, watching Netflix for gosh sakes while you're driving or something. All of these things that seem to be obvious use cases, that just doesn't seem like a good idea for me. Again, it does feel like that, yes, it's a neat accessory onto the phone, but largely, the reason this is the next big thing is, I think, because no one has any better ideas, not because it is a great idea.
Emily Flippen: That's an interesting way to put it. I'll just quickly tap off by saying, I wish Apple was OK with being second, in some cases. I think when you look at the success of the smartphone, Apple wasn't the first company to come out with a smartphone, but they waited for the proof and the pudding there with Blackberry before they entered the market and destroyed it. The same is true for smart watches. They waited for Garmin and others to come out, fit bit to show the demand for watches, and then said, let's take this market that already exists, and let's crush it. The market doesn't exist right now for these glasses. I think that's part of the problem that Apple's running up against.
Travis Hoium: When we come back, we are going to get to Tesla's phenomenal delivery numbers for the third quarter of 2025 and see what the future looks like because this may be a peak for a while. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
One of the other big pieces of news for the week was Tesla had a phenomenal quarter. Deliveries were 497,099 vehicles. That was a 7.4% increase from a year ago. The problem is, the $7,500 tax credit ended at the end of the third quarter. Emily, is this going to be as good as it gets for Tesla, at least for the foreseeable future?
Emily Flippen: I think it's a fair statement. I do think two things can be true at once, which is, that this was a great delivery month they put up, but it was also this deadline sprint that you mentioned for people to place orders before the tax credit expired. If I had to estimate, I would imagine that we're probably looking at a softer fourth quarter here, despite how strong the third quarter was in terms of deliveries, but at the same time, I'm still really bullish on the entire EV sector, especially in the United States, but across the world. I think the rumors of its death, so to speak, have been greatly exaggerated. There's a lot of people out there, a lot of investors who think that without government incentives, demand for electric vehicles just won't be there. It's an interesting argument, and it's one that I think we're going to get some more evidence toward or against as we see these tax credits expire, but big picture, we've seen higher interest rates, and that softens demand for more expensive cars. EVs are still on average, more expensive than more traditional vehicles, and you still need to have the installation and charging options. A lot of people choose to finance those if they have them installed on their house. Of course, with higher interest rates, less people being willing to finance at higher rates. There's a lot of factors that are going against EV adoption right now that are unlikely to persist over the long term. That's the thing where I'm like, it's great to see a Sean Carter from Tesla. I'm not expecting that to persist for Tesla or any other EV maker. I think Ford's CEO, which is commenting earlier this week that he expects EV market share to drop by half for this foreseeable future. Crazy numbers. But when I zoom out 10 years, I'm very not worried about electric vehicles here.
Lou Whiteman: Here's the interesting thing to me. These are the times autos are very cyclical. These are the times when historically, the big giants of the industry, based at Detroit, through most of the industry, they've used their balance sheet to muscle out competitors. When pricing becomes a problem, when affordability becomes a problem, and Ford today still has that great captive Auto Finance unit. GM is rebuilding theirs, where they really can offer you a deal you can't refuse. Someone else who's smaller, in this case, a Rivian, back in the day with others just can't afford to. On paper, Tesla is better positioned to do that than even the Detroit companies. They have a great balance sheet. However, Tesla, unlike all of these companies, also has a huge long list of things other than consumer finance they want to put their money to. I feel like to some extent, Tesla's near term destiny is in their own hands. If they want to minimize the blow of the tax credit, I think they have the wherewithal to do that. I don't know if for long term investors, that would be the best use of their capital, though, but I mean, I do think it's an interesting moment. In terms of the big picture for EVs, for me, right now, it makes sense that hybrids are where it's at because I think hybrids offer you a better deal, and I'm biased because I have a hybrid. Maybe I'm saying that. To me, the future of EVs is not tied to tax credits. It's not tied to what Elon Musk thinks when he wakes up in the morning. You tell me how and when that Model 2 hits the streets. You tell me if that Model 2 really is a $25,000 car. I will tell you what I think the near term future for Tesla EVs are. Similarly, all of these companies, Ford has a pickup truck. That's a very similar value proposition. Tell me whether or not those actually can be made at profit anytime soon. That, I think, is going to be the answer to the question of how quickly and how strongly we see EVs take off from here, not a $7,000 tax credit.
Emily Flippen: Why are we so focused on Tesla and Ford when we actually already have evidence that is the case. BYD out of China has been making profitable, low cost electric vehicles that are getting worldwide adoption. We don't see them a lot here in the United States because of our own tariff regime and lack of importing there. But I do think that we have evidence that this battery company, originally a battery company now a big car company can do it. There's no reason to believe that others can't eventually get there, as well. But that evidence exists. It's just a matter of, to your point, Lou, how quickly?
Travis Hoium: Absolutely. Speaking of companies that are growing in EVs, I think this one's fascinating is General Motors, do you know how much their EV growth was year over year? Gulf the third quarter, 105% to 144,668 vehicles. The Equinox EV, which is their entry level, $35,100. I believe that's less than you can get a Tesla for today. It does seem the dynamics have shifted quite a bit. What will be fascinating, they're still focusing on big trucks and SUVs. That's where the money is made, even though Tesla used to be high margin. Their margins are now lower than the traditional automakers today. It's partly because they're not making these expensive trucks and SUVs, which are selling like crazy today. This is going to be fascinating because it does seem like one thing that's going to be consistent is the market will probably not be growing as much as it would have had that $7,500 tax credit remained, and therefore, it's going to be more competitive because there is more supply coming into the mat.
Lou Whiteman: The one caveat there, I would say on just looking at GM numbers is, I think the dealer model provides more incentive to try and get move metal before the tax credit disappears because as soon as it's on location, that's the dealers problem, not the automakers problem. The dealers don't have that balance sheet to put to work. They wanted to move that metal. But we'll see if it holds up, that's great for GM.
Travis Hoium: I want to get your thoughts on we have the end of the third quarter just happened this week on Tuesday. That means the earning season is going to be coming very soon. Emily, what are you looking at for this earning season as it starts next week and the week after?
Emily Flippen: I'm actually looking for companies that are very obviously sandbagging with guidance. I say that, I think we all expect for guidance this quarter to come in weaker. It was that case last quarter. We are living in a really uncertain environment now, so it makes sense that not only are companies expecting their profit margins to be squeezed, especially with weak consumer spending, they don't know what's going to happen with inflation or tariffs, whatever the overhang may be. I always love it when a company's management team is always a bit more pessimistic than I'm, and sometimes I can be a red flag, but sometimes I can also be a buying opportunity. For instance, I think about Dutch Bros, who when you look back at their business at this point last year, kept guiding for low to mid single digit same store sales growth, so much weaker than what they were putting up because management was just that uncertain about the cannibalization that'd be happening with their business or consumer spending. Quarter after quarter, they just kept hitting it out of the park they only recently raised guidance. But that mismatch, in my opinion, between a really conservative management team and a really strong business, where I can see their path to out performance, even more than maybe management can, can be appealing because if you see shares fall really dramatically based on weak guidance that you think is a hurdle that can be easily passed, it can be a buying opportunity.
Lou Whiteman: It's so funny you say that because I was thinking the other day. I was like, I'm more excited about the opportunity to go shopping this earning season than normal. I do think that that's yeah, we're ripe for it, I think. All the containers are there. As far as what I'm looking for, I'll go big picture. I'm focused on margins just across the board. I'm really curious how much the macro is eating into margins. We know there's tariffs out there. We know that the consumer is struggling to get a feel for how much that companies are eating it. I think I'm more interested in looking at margin change over time than I'm even, revenue growth or earnings growth. I want to know not what happened in the last three months. I want to know what to expect the next three, six months to come, and I think that is at least a little bit of a window into what's going on out there.
Travis Hoium: Lou, do you think tariffs is going to be a bigger topic of discussion or less than it was over the last two quarters? I'll say maybe the second quarter, first quarter was a lot of, we have no idea what's going on. Second quarter, companies have gotten their heads around it. Third quarter, now we're really in it. Are we going to hear a lot about it, or is it going to just be in the background?
Lou Whiteman: I think we're going to hear a ton about it, but I think it's going to be in the guidance side because we're in the holiday quarter now, and I think that that's going to be front of mind. Travis, I've used this with you before the boiling frog analogy that you, tariffs are not a light switch. It's just over time, suddenly what happened? The holiday season seems like if I was a CEO, that would be front of mind for me at the holiday season. I think you'll be hearing about it a lot in the guidance.
Travis Hoium: It is going to be fascinating to see what companies can who has pricing power. Who doesn't? Who has to, like you said, eat those tariffs and who's able to pass them on to customers and where they're impacting a lot to learn over the next few weeks. When we come back, I'm going to have Emily and Lou take an over or under position on a bunch of predictions for the rest of the year you're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Today, we're going to play a little game called over-under. I'm going to give a prediction about something that's going to happen in the economy or the market, and Emily and Lou are going to guess whether they think there's going to be an over or under. Let's start with the topic that we discussed earlier, Metas Glasses. They sold about 1 million pairs of these smart glasses in 2024. That's a pretty big number. My question is, are they going to sell over or under 5 million units in 2028? Emily, I'm going to have you go first over or under 5 million.
Emily Flippen: I feel this will come as no surprise for anybody who listen to the first half of the show, but I have to go under here. I just don't see the use cases for it on Meta side. When you look at Metas financials, this business spent more on CapEx in the last 12 months than the business generated in operating income or an operating cash flow in all of 2022. They are just throwing money at the wall, and it's amazing to me how much money they're investing into various things, but nothing is sticking with consumers. Ultimately, you can't force a consumer to come out and buy a new product if they don't see a use case for it. It's amazing to me that they even sold 1 million units in 2024. That is peak hype, in my opinion. Unless something really sticks here for Meta, I expect that number to actually fall over the course of the next.
Lou Whiteman: Wow. I'm going to use Emily's words and come to the conclusion that over. Because, yes, Zuck needs this, and Zuck is more than willing to spend money, and Zuck is still hurting about.
Travis Hoium: You may just give them away.
Lou Whiteman: I wasn't going to go quite that far, but since you got there, I don't think that profitability, I'm glad we're talking volume. We're talking units, not profitability or success here.
Travis Hoium: But, I don't think we're under the delusion that these are going to be profitable in the next three years.
Lou Whiteman: My guess is, he's going to move these darn things. Come high or high water.
Travis Hoium: This will be interesting because I do think the adoption of the VR space really hit a wall. But glasses are different. Glasses are a little bit more passive. They're not quite lower cost, which is, I think, interesting $800 for these new display glasses. But there's definitely a market for it. The other thing to think about, too, is if you bought one in 2024, when are you going to want to update that? If there's not a lot of new features, that could be a headwind, too. We'll be fascinated to see how successful or unsuccessful Meta is moving into more of the glasses space. Let's go to the overall economy, and I want to get your thoughts on mortgage rates. The reason that I think this is important is housing is a huge driver of the economy. It's huge portion of our money is spent on rents, on mortgages. It provides tons of jobs. Higher mortgage rates, at least than we've had over the past decade, has been a real headwind. Fed funds rate is coming down. The rate that the Fed controls is coming down. The problem is, the longer term rates that drive mortgage rates and the borrowing rates for companies is not coming down at the same rate. Right now, we have a mortgage rate average of about 6.3% a year from now, do you think those mortgage rates are going to be over or under 6%? Down just slightly from where we are today, Lou how you go?
Lou Whiteman: Getting a real time lesson in the limits to the Fed's power. Wait, there's just so much going on other than the Fed that's driving these long term rates. I'm going under, and I'm not sure it's a good thing. I'm all over the place. What's going to happen in the economy in the next year? But I'm increasingly worried, I think, and I think that there's going to need to be more and more aggressiveness. I think housing is a natural place for both politics and policy to get involved here. I don't want to go too much under there, but I have a feeling we'll be eventually pushed downward one way or the other.
Emily Flippen: Might be a hot take here, but we're sitting at about 6% right now, and I think the general expectation is that the market can handle the housing market can handle these high rates for very much longer, and that the Fed is going to continue to cut rates, which eventually, hopefully, even though there is obviously a disconnect here between the Fed is doing and what lenders are doing, that will eventually come down, but I have to say over. I think mortgage rates are going to be over 6% one year from now. The reason is is because I don't actually think we're going to get as many rate cuts as the market is expecting. I think that tepidness is going to pull over into the market for mortgages. The reason I say that is because a lot of the inflation data, despite the fact that it has cooled off, and it's down, although obviously not to Fed's target rates, I expect that we probably heat up as a lot more of these price increases from tariffs are passed along to consumers in the back half of this year, a lot of that evidence has shown that companies so far have eaten the price of these tariffs, and that is eventually that dam is eventually going to break. In my opinion, that's unfortunately going to impact interest rates.
Travis Hoium: I do think it is interesting that we have not really seen we've been talking about this on these shows for months. We have not really seen the impact of tariffs yet. The inventory cycle for a lot of these companies is not a month or two. If tariffs went in place, April 2, it's not like you're going to see that in stores, even in June. They were planning in April now for the holidays. This is when we're going to see those price increases. I have kids. We're buying stuff for them all the time, and you're seeing those prices go up. I'm interested to see if that impacts consumers. Emily, is your point just that the market is going to say, you know what? Sure, these rates are going to come down short term, but long term, they're going to have to go back up to fight inflation.
Emily Flippen: I think it's going to be a combination between a weaker labor market and inflation here that's going to put the Fed in a bit of an odd position. Ultimately, I think, whenever you see broader economic concerns in combination with the dynamics that we're seeing in terms of the housing market today, I would just be surprised if rates fall that dramatically within one year. I hope I am wrong. I do tend to be a pessimist, and I like to be pleasantly surprised. I hope a year from now we're sitting here in October 2026, talking about our nice four per to 5% mortgages. But that feels like a pipe dream to me these days.
Lou Whiteman: You know what's fascinating, Emily, I'm pessimistic, too, but I think in the near term, it's easier to play games with it, and in the long term, it eventually comes back to bite you. I'm focused on the one year, too, but who knows? That's what makes market.
Travis Hoium: Let's quickly do an over under on the number of fed rate cuts in the next 12 months. Emily, it sounds you're going under three. That's where I'm going to set the bar. But is that officially your call?
Emily Flippen: It is. In fact, I'll tell you what. In the next 12 months, I will even go further. I think we have maybe one rate cut.
Travis Hoium: The market is pricing into this year.
Emily Flippen: Yes.
Travis Hoium: You don't think that's going to happen in 12 months?
Emily Flippen: I don't talked about this on Motley Fool Money in the past, I believe. I think I expected one rate cut in September, which we got. Despite the fact that all of the blind polling here from the Federal Reserve does indicate that even the people on the panel themselves expect a number of rate cuts over the remainder of the year.
Emily Flippen: We don't have, obviously, with the government shutdown, our most recent jobs data, and inflation has not moderated. I can't emphasize this enough. It has not moderated to the extent that the Fed wants it to moderate. It's still well above their target rate. We've actually seen it accelerates on a month over month basis, and there's a fair bit of evidence that despite the fact that tariffs have not had the impact that I think a lot of economists and investors fear to this point, which is wonderful, that that shoe is, in my opinion, likely to drop toward the back half of the year. Again, I really hope I'm wrong here. I really hope mortgage rates come down. I really hope we have three rate cuts. But I'm betting on one rate cut in the next.
Lou Whiteman: I really hope I'm wrong, Ron Gur, because for the record, I agree. If you want me, I play pundit. I agree with everything Emily said. I was reluctant to even cut the first time. I was scared about that, and I don't want rate cuts. I'm worried about inflation. But again, I think politics plays into this, and especially as the year goes on with the Fed. I think market dynamics is providing pressure. Officially, I would push to three. I think we are at three. But, if anything, if you force me not to push, I'm going to take the over. That scares me a bit, but I do think that just the pressure on the Fed to cut rates is only going to accelerate as Pal steps away and as other changes, and as just assist the situation, I'm afraid we are going to deteriorate some from here.
Travis Hoium: Lou, I did allow you to push on that one, but this one, we're going to make things a little bit more difficult. NVIDIA is the most valuable company in the world, $4.6 trillion market cap; Microsoft, 3.9, Apple, 3.8 trillion. My question for you, is NVIDIA going to be over or under the 1.5? Basically, are they going to be first or are they going to be lower than first? Most valuable company on January 1st, 2030. You have a little over four years between now and then. Are they going to maintain this ranking?
Lou Whiteman: Any good gambler has to take the field on that. I'm going to take the field and say under. However, NVIDIA is a pretty good choice to be there. It's a great company. They have staying power. But no, if you're going to give me every company or NVIDIA and have it play out four years, I'll take everybody else.
Emily Flippen: Unfortunately, if you look historically speaking, companies that are the largest in the world when you zoom out in a 5-10 year period don't tend to maintain that positioning. I have to agree with Lou here, I to take the under. That being said, if anybody can do it, it's NVIDIA. This would be, and you hate as an investor to say this time is different, but this could be the exception to the rule.
Travis Hoium: We'll end on this one. I want to get your S&P 500 picks over the next 12 months. Over or under 7,000. As we're recording, we're at about 6,750. I'm giving a little bit of a gain, 5% gain or so. Do you think a year from now we are under 7,000 on the S&P 500, Emily?
Emily Flippen: This is an interesting question because I think everyone in their dough will tell you right now that the S&P 500 is overvalued. The market is overvalued. We have all of these headwinds, consumers are feeling hurt. The government, as we are talking, is literally shut down, and the stock market is up. Make that make sense, exactly. There is this real disconnect that's happening between the American consumer, the American economy, and, I guess, general vibes of the American people here versus what we're seeing in the market. I fear that the irrationality, to some extent, can maintain over the course of the next year because it hasn't made a lot of sense to this point. That being said, I can't get behind why that would be. I have to take the under. I think it's less than five. In fact, I think the stock markets probably down from where we are today a year from now. Again, I hope I'm wrong, and pessimists sound smart, optimists tend to make more money, so I'm staying fully invested, regardless of what my short-term prediction is for the markets. But it's hard for me to rationalize how the market could go up from here, given the factors and the headwinds that we're seeing in the broader economy.
Lou Whiteman: It's hard to disagree with that. I've been all doom and gloom when we were talking about the Fed and stuff, but here's the deal. I do think that it's ""priced in."" I think one of the weird things is Liberation Day was such a shock that we just normalized that or became immune to that real quick. I am more confident that we aren't going massively in one direction or the other. I think it's going to just be a grind, but I'm going to take the over. I think that we can just grind along almost regardless of what's going on on Main Street for a while.
Travis Hoium: When we come back, we will get to stocks on our radar. You are listening to Motley Fool Monday.

To see our full advertising disclosure, please check out our show notes. One of the interesting news items for the week is Spotify founder and CEO, Daniel Ek, is stepping down. He is going to be replaced by co-CEOs Gustav Soderstrom and Alex Norstrom. Emily, this has been a phenomenal run for Spotify and for Ek over the past three years. I think they've solidified their business model, but going with the co CEO strategy seems to be a trend, too. What did you take away from this announcement?
Emily Flippen: I was really disappointed by this announcement because, as you mentioned, Travis, wow, it looks good for Spotify over the last couple of years; it wasn't always the case. When Spotify first went public, part of my conviction behind the business was the way that Dan Ek talked about the company being very focused on the long term, and investors can forget that there is a period for Spotify there, a very long period where investors were very pessimistic, believing that Spotify would never be able to get its gross margin above 30% because of the limits and the caps on the way that the licensing agreements for music operated. Dan Ek had a really impressive long-term vision for what the Spotify platform could be, and he really did execute well on that, raised prices when it was appropriate, while expanding into things like audiobooks and podcasting, of which so many people, even internally in Spotify, were very skeptical about his investments there. Ek led that initiative. It's disappointing to see him leave, even though he will stay on his executive chair. I don't love co-CEOs in general, but I will say if anybody can pull it off, it's possibly this pair. Norstrom and Soderstrom have already acted together as co-presidents of Spotify. They seem to have different expertise, one more product, one more operational. Hopefully they'll find a way to marry in that sense, but the devil's always in the details, and it's scary when you have a founder, CEO leaving the helm of a great company.
Lou Whiteman: Everything in my gut makes me want to hate the co CEO structure. You need one person in charge. I think I need to get over that, though. We've seen it in a lot of companies. I do think, look, the CEO title has always been vague. It means different things in different companies. It's too much for one human being to do all the work of a big company. Average tenure of CEOs is falling, so you need to have a lot of talent there. I think if you look at this case, and I think there's a good chance it works. I think the idea of just we're almost just recategorizing what we call people. When inevitably, nobody was multitasking everything, and everybody had different roles, anyway. I think what's evolving more is just how we describe these things, not how companies work. You need the right people. You need well-defined roles. You need, maybe a founder as executive chairman to play referee if needed. I think it can work, and I need to be less scared of it. Hopefully for the best year.
Travis Hoium: It has been interesting to see Netflix has done a similar thing, where they have different expertise. It does seem like a two-headed dragon at the top, and these companies are so big now that maybe that makes sense because it's a huge job to fill. Let's get to the stocks that are on our radar. We're going to bring in Dan Boyd from behind the glass. Lou, I'm going to have you go first. What's on your radar this week?
Lou Whiteman: Dan, I'm looking at Delta Airlines, ticker DAL. They kick off transport earnings next week, Thursday, I think, should set the tone not just for airlines, but could provide insight into the consumer, into big macro, and all that. Baseline expectations is that corporate travel is holding up better than tourists. International is steady, and premium products are in demand. If that proves true, that is really good news for investors not just in Delta, but United too, which I think Delta and United, probably the best stocks in this sector. Very curious to hear what they have to say and what we can read into the entire sector from them.
Travis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about getting into airline stocks?
Dan Boyd: Now, Lou, you are a Georgia guy. How much of this is blind Homerism?
Lou Whiteman: I haven't lived in Georgia that long.
Dan Boyd: You're saying none?
Lou Whiteman: No.
Dan Boyd: I don't believe it. I don't believe that for a second.
Lou Whiteman: Dan, as someone who flies Delta regularly, I have all the reason in the world to hate them, trust me.
Dan Boyd: Fair enough.
Lou Whiteman: Emily, what's on your watch list?
Emily Flippen: Well, hopefully, a stock that generates a little less hate than Delta Airlines. I'm looking at Mercado Libre. The ticker is MELI. Mercado Libre shares are down about 15% this week because this e-commerce behemoth that operates in South America looks like it's getting a bit of renewed competition from Amazon. Amazon announcing that in their attempt to expand their presence in Brazil, they'd be waiving additional fees for sellers and fulfillment by Amazon throughout the country over the holiday season. In my opinion, this is a great buying opportunity, Dan. You have to listen to me here because Mercado Libre's been there, done that. Sea Limited, with the Shoppe app, tried to move into Brazil in Latin America, South America, a couple of years ago, and got absolutely trounced by Mercado Libre. Mercado Libre has by far the biggest lead in this space. I couldn't be less concerned for the lead they have here, and with shares off around 15%. What's a better time to be buying?
Travis Hoium: Dan, Emily's going with a long-term winner compared to the troubling industry in the airlines. What do you think about Mercado Libre?
Dan Boyd: She said, you have to listen to me. Travis, so I guess I have to listen to Emily now.
Emily Flippen: Let this be a lesson to ask for what you want in life.
Travis Hoium: What's going on your watch list? Is it officially Mercado Libre?
Dan Boyd: It's definitely going to be Mercado Libre. I think the price point might be a little too good to ignore these days.
Lou Whiteman: For Lou Whiteman, Emily Flippen, our production leader, Dan Boyd, and the entire Motley Fool team, I'm Travis Hoium. Thanks for listening to Motley Fool Money. We'll see you here tomorrow."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.2%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) decreased roughly 0.7% after fresh record high closes on Wall Street.
The pullback in stocks comes after the S&P and Nasdaq both scored their seventh win in a row on Monday, boosted by news of a multibillion-dollar deal between AMD (AMD) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) that sent the chip company's stock rocketing higher.
But the AI trade lost some steam Tuesday, led by a decline in Oracle (ORCL) stock after a report said the profit margin in its cloud computing business was likely lower than many Wall Street forecasts. Shares of Oracle fell as much as 7% throughout the day but closed 2% lower.
Tesla (TSLA) shares also lost steam, dropping 4%, after the EV maker unveiled a cheaper Model Y priced under $40,000 on Tuesday in a launch initially teased in a series of cryptic social media posts.

Stocks retreat from record highs as Oracle shares sink
Stocks pulled back from record highs on Tuesday as Oracle (ORCL) shares fell after a report suggested the software giant’s cloud-computing margins may be smaller than what Wall Street anticipates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), S&P 500 (^GSPC), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) all fell less than 1% after the broader index and tech-heavy gauge notched new records in the prior session.
Stocks turned negative after a report from the Information stated that internal documents show Oracle's overall gross margin has fallen to 67.3%, its lowest in more than a year, amid heavy spending on chips and data center expansion.
Oracle stock fell 7% before trimming losses. At the close, it was down 2%.

Gold’s melt-up could be due for a pause or pullback, says strategist
Gold could be due for a pullback following a massive year-to-date gain of more than 50%, warns one strategist.
Gold rallied to record highs above $4,000 on Tuesday after completing a seven-week winning streak.
""A breakout above the channel would be a bullish sign for a continuation of the accelerating uptrend,"" said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial.
""However, a failure here would suggest gold’s melt-up could be due for a pause or pullback,"" he added.
Turnquist noted the latest leg higher has been underpinned by growing uncertainty over the US government shutdown and fear of missing out (FOMO) flows into physical gold ETFs, which reached record levels in September and the last quarter.

Bull market 'on track' despite fears of AI bubble, says UBS
Megadeals with the AI industry have been fueling market euphoria.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) latest deals with heavyweights like AMD, Nvidia, Oracle, and Broadcom pushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) into its seventh consecutive day of gains on Tues, its longest winning streak since May.
“With hundreds of billions in investment commitments and the bull market on track for its three-year anniversary, fears of an AI bubble that could rival the dotcom era are mounting. But there have been warnings of a bubble for almost as long as the AI boom has been in full swing,"" said UBS strategists led by Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer Americas and Global Head of Equities at UBS.
""In our view, a period of consolidation would not come as a surprise after such a strong recent run, but we believe the equity rally is underpinned by solid fundamentals that should continue to support the market.”
On Tuesday, tech stocks pulled back after a report suggested that Oracle's (ORCL) cloud-computing margins may be smaller than what Wall Street has been estimating.

Oracle shares sink on report margins are smaller than what Wall Street expects
Oracle (ORCL) shares fell on Tuesday, weighing on the broader market after a report suggested the software giant’s cloud-computing margins are smaller than what Wall Street expects.
According to the Information, internal documents show Oracle generated about $900 million from renting Nvidia-powered servers during the quarter ended in August, but earned just $125 million in gross profit. The company’s overall gross margin fell to 67.3%, its lowest in more than a year, amid heavy spending on chips and data-center expansion.
The report said Oracle lost “considerable” sums on some smaller Nvidia chip rentals.
Oracle shares sank 3% during Tuesday's session. Shares have surged more than 60% this year on surging AI demand and a deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) to provide 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity.

Qualcomm to acquire Arduino amid edge computing push
Qualcomm (QCOM) stock edged higher in premarket trading on Monday after the company announced that it is acquiring open-source hardware and software developer Arduino as it seeks to expand its footprint in the edge computing space and diversify beyond the smartphone market.
Global crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew record inflows of $5.95 billion for the week ending Oct. 4, as bitcoin surged to a record high, Reuters reports.
According to data from CoinShares, US crypto ETFs led with $5 billion in inflows, followed by Switzerland with $563 million and Germany with $312 million.
Constellation Brands stock pops as Corona maker calls out 'dampened consumer demand'
Constellation Brands (STZ) stock has been significantly underperforming — down 37% year to date — and a challenging socioeconomic environment is making a turnaround difficult, the company said on Monday.
""In the second quarter of fiscal 2026 we continued to navigate a difficult socioeconomic environment that dampened consumer demand across the industry,"" Constellation Brands CEO Bill Newlands said in an earnings release.
Newlands cited weakness in employment trends, softening consumer sentiment, and ongoing concerns from Hispanic consumers that are leading to fewer gatherings.
The maker of Corona and Modelo beer reported a profit of $2.65 per share in its fiscal second quarter, a marked improvement from its loss of $6.59 per share a year ago. However, net sales fell 7% and earnings missed Wall Street's target of $3.32 per share. Revenue of $2.48 billion topped the Street's expectations of $2.45 billion.
Constellation Brands also lowered its unadjusted outlook to $9.86-$10.16 a share from its previous forecast of $10.77-$11.07. Net sales are expected to decline 4% to 6% for the year.
The stock rose 3% in premarket trading on Tuesday, following the release of quarterly results after the bell on Monday.

Oct 6 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed more than 3.5% Monday morning after the EV giant dropped a series of cryptic video teasers hinting at a possible new car reveal.
The clips, which ended with 10/7, featured close-up shots of car parts and headlights, enough to set off a wave of speculation across social media.
Many Tesla watchers believe the company could finally unveil its long-awaited affordable, mass-market vehicle, a model investors see as key to reigniting sales momentum. Others think it could be the long-delayed next-generation Roadster, which CEO Elon Musk recently described on X as something special beyond a car.
The stock rebound came after a rough week in which Tesla reported record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 units, up 7% year over year. Analysts, however, caution that much of that growth was driven by a pre-deadline rush to secure $7,500 federal EV tax credits before they expired on September 30.
Hargreaves Lansdown's Matt Britzman said the teasers could point to an entry-level Model Y, adding that the vehicle's pricing and timing will determine how much demand Tesla can unlock amid intensifying global EV competition."

Musk's Tesla posts cryptic videos as analysts expect cheaper Model Y reveal
Elon Musk's Tesla posted a pair of social media videos over the weekend that tease an unspecified announcement for Tuesday.
Tesla's main account on X, the Musk-owned social media platform, posted a video early Sunday morning of a wheel or fan showing Tesla's logo starting to spin before accelerating.
The video then goes to black with the date 10/7 displayed, suggesting an announcement of some sort on Oct. 7.
Tesla posted a second video later on Sunday that showed a car's headlights on with the body of the vehicle cloaked in darkness. Tesla shares rose in anticipation of the announcement, climbing more than 4% in Monday trading.
TESLA OFFERS MASSIVE $1 TRILLION PAY PACKAGE TO ELON MUSK
The teaser videos follow Tesla's record third-quarter deliveries, which were driven by a surge in EV purchases ahead of the expiration of the federal government's $7,500 EV tax credit on Sept. 30.
Despite the boost from a strong third quarter, analysts expect Tesla's annual deliveries to decline for a second consecutive year to about 1.62 million vehicles, amid less demand due to the expiration of EV purchase incentives as well as political headwinds from Musk's work with the Trump administration.

Tesla previously delayed the rollout of a lower-cost version of the Model Y in the U.S. to help spur more demand amid sluggish sales of EVs.
The company said in June it had made ""first builds"" of the vehicle but would start selling it in the fourth quarter and ramp up output at a pace that would be slower than planned.
The stripped-down version is designed to be about 20% cheaper to produce than the refreshed Model Y and could scale to about 250,000 units a year in the U.S. by 2026.
ELON MUSK BUYS $1B WORTH OF TESLA SHARES
Wall Street expects Tesla's deliveries to rebound to 1.85 million vehicles next year, with the cheaper model accounting for 155,610 units in 2026, per estimates from Visible Alpha.
""Tesla is teasing something big as a flurry of X posts has fans bracing for what looks like the launch of a more affordable Model Y tomorrow,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.
""The price tag will be the real tell, offering clues on how far Tesla has pushed cost savings and how much new demand it can unlock,"" Britzman added.
Tesla hasn't launched a new mass-market vehicle in years and has instead relied heavily on making incremental updates to the Model 3 and Model Y to drive sales.

However, 74% of the company's revenue still comes from selling passenger electric vehicles (EVs) like the Model 3, Model S, and Model Y, and sales plummeted in the first half of this year.
Fortunately, Tesla just released its production and delivery numbers for the third quarter (ended Sept. 30) and it appears sales are finally growing again. This is great news for investors, but there's a catch.
Tesla might have borrowed a few sales from the fourth quarter
Tesla's EV deliveries shrank by 1% to 1.79 million units during 2024, marking the first annual decline in sales since the launch of its flagship Model S in 2011. Then, in the first half of 2025, deliveries were down by a whopping 13% year over year, to just 720,803 cars.
Rising competition is a big reason why. For example, Tesla's sales have steadily declined across Europe this year, despite EV sales growing overall across the region. Meanwhile, China-based manufacturer BYD is experiencing explosive demand in Europe, and it even outsold Tesla in July and August. It seems budget-conscious consumers are choosing lower-cost options, rather than premium EVs like those sold by Tesla.
But Tesla delivered 497,099 EVs worldwide during the third quarter, representing an increase of 7% compared to the year-ago period. It was a very welcome return to growth, so is the tide turning? Maybe not -- on Sept. 30, the U.S. government's $7,500 EV tax credit expired, so many American consumers who were planning to buy a car within the next few months probably pulled the trigger earlier to take advantage of the incentive.
In other words, Tesla probably pulled some sales forward from the fourth quarter, which means the October to December period might be considerably weaker, at least in the U.S.
All eyes are on Tesla's future product platforms
Tesla stock is wildly expensive right now (which I'll discuss further in a moment), so it's clear investors aren't valuing the company based on its EV sales alone. Instead, they are looking several years into the future, and trying to estimate how valuable products like the Cybercab and Optimus could be.
The Cybercab is designed to run on Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) software. The company's goal is to have millions of these cars on the road, autonomously hauling passengers around the clock to generate a high-margin revenue stream. However, Tesla's FSD software isn't approved for unsupervised use anywhere in the U.S. just yet, which could be a problem considering the robotaxi is slated to enter mass production in 2026.
Plus, it places Tesla significantly behind the competition. Alphabet's Waymo is already completing over 250,000 paid autonomous trips every single week in five U.S. cities, and it partnered with Uber Technologies, so it has access to the world's largest ride-hailing network. Tesla not only has to prove the viability of its autonomous technology, but it also has to build an entire network from the ground up.
Turning to the Optimus robot, CEO Elon Musk believes this product platform will generate $10 trillion in revenue for Tesla over the long term, because humanoid robots will have several use-cases for both businesses and households. In fact, he believes robots will outnumber humans by 2040.
However, Optimus will take even longer than the Cybercab to make a meaningful contribution to Tesla's financial results. Production is expected to begin in 2026, but Musk says it could take five years to reach Tesla's target output of 1 million units per year -- and that's assuming there is real demand, which is a big unknown right now.
Tesla stock is trading at a sky-high valuation
The Nasdaq-100 technology index is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.6 as I write this. Nvidia stock, on the other hand, trades at a premium P/E ratio of 53.7, mainly because of the company's incredible growth and the enormous future demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
Then there is Tesla stock, which trades at a staggering P/E ratio of around 252. That would be difficult to justify even if Tesla's business was booming, but its earnings shrank by 31% in the first half of this year because of its weak EV sales.
As a result, it's very difficult to advocate for buying Tesla stock based on what we know right now, especially with a potentially weak fourth quarter on the horizon. Optimus and the Cybercab would have to become incredible success stories to justify the company's current valuation, but even if you believe that will be the case, it could take several years to unfold.
In the meantime, Tesla's rich P/E ratio leaves its stock vulnerable to a significant correction."

- Shares of Tesla are rising to start the week. Part of the reason could be anticipation regarding an event, expected tomorrow, at which some watchers believe news of a more affordable EV could arrive.
- Tesla was the best-performing stock in the Magnificent 7 in the third quarter.
Tesla is kicking off the week with a bit of mystery.
The company yesterday posted a short video on X depicting a spinning wheel and Tuesday's date. It later shared another showing the headlights of a vehicle, details of which couldn't be easily seen.
Tesla (TSLA) didn't respond to Investopedia's request for further comment in time for publication. On its YouTube page, where it sometimes posts product and other company news, there was no sign of an event set for tomorrow. That hasn't stopped plenty of folks from reading between the lines.
Why This Matters to Investors
The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite is outperforming the other leading U.S. indexes Monday, a sign of investor appetite for growth in the form of rising tech shares. Tesla is just one measure of that, with investors looking to a teased announcement tomorrow as the latest catalyst for the company's stock.
The posts raised speculation that the company could announce a lower-priced EV. There's reason for that: Executives during the company's earnings call in July said Tesla expected to have ""more affordable models available for everyone"" in the fourth quarter of this year.
A range of reports seem to expect that the announcement will involve a Model Y, which currently starts a bit below $45,000. (Some have speculated that a Roadster might be arriving.) Whatever we may learn, it follows third-quarter deliveries news that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, even as many investors are looking beyond quarter-to-quarter vehicle sales.
Relevant Education
Today's movement in Tesla's share price—it's recently up about 4% on an upbeat day for stocks—might indicate that there are still investors out there who track those numbers closely, though some might counter that car sales are particularly valuable as a platform for sales of autonomous driving options or even pieces of a future robotaxi network.
Whatever the case, the good vibes around the stock—the best-performing company in the Magnificent 7 in the third quarter—are continuing today."

Despite mounting concerns over a government shutdown and fresh warnings of an AI ""bubble,"" strategists across Wall Street say there's still upside for US equities heading into year-end.
Ed Yardeni, veteran market watcher and president of Yardeni Research, raised his S&P 500 (^GSPC) target back to 7,000, describing the current rally as a ""slow-motion melt-up"" fueled by earnings resilience and further support from Fed rate cuts.
Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel echoed that view, keeping a base-case target of 7,750 for 2026 and assigning a 30% chance of a ""bubble scenario"" that could see the S&P 500 hit 9,000 by the end of next year, driven by accelerating capital markets and continued AI investment.
Signs of that exuberance are already emerging: On Monday, OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) announced a multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that gives the ChatGPT maker the right to acquire up to 10% of the chipmaker as part of what executives have described as ""the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.""
That wave of AI spending has prompted several high-profile voices to weigh in. Last week, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos described the current boom as a ""good kind of bubble"" that could spark massive investment and innovation, ultimately benefiting the broader economy.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon offered a more cautious tone, warning that while tech and stimulus tailwinds could keep the economy accelerating into 2026, investors should not be surprised to see a drawdown in the next 12 to 24 months as some capital fails to generate returns.
The debate over whether markets are veering into bubble territory comes as valuations hover well above historical norms.
According to DataTrek Research, the S&P 500 is trading at about 25 times expected earnings for this year, a level the firm said ""reflects complete confidence (and then some)"" that profits will meet expectations. That implies earnings will climb 13% next year and another 10% in 2027.
That means ""higher valuations than historical norms are the key to further upside for the S&P 500,"" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote. He added that ""solid earnings growth over the next 2–3 years [is] already baked into stock prices.""
In other words, much of this rally still rests on the shoulders of Big Tech."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 47 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 4.1% on the news that the stock extended its negative momentum as the company reported record third-quarter deliveries that beat expectations, but investors grew concerned about future demand.
Tesla delivered a record 497,099 vehicles, which was well above forecasts. However, the market reacted negatively because the strong sales were largely attributed to a rush from U.S. consumers to buy an electric vehicle before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of September. This created a belief among investors that demand was pulled forward, potentially leading to a weaker fourth quarter and the following year. Adding to the concerns, the record results were also offset by a continuing sales slowdown in the European market.
Tesla is up 17.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $446.78 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,238.

However, analysts expect Tesla's annual deliveries to fall for a second straight year to about 1.62 million vehicles, as expiring incentives and a demand slowdown linked to CEO Musk's polarizing politics weigh on sales.
Tesla has previously delayed rolling out a lower-cost version of the Model Y in the U.S. It said in June it had made ""first builds"" of the vehicle, but would start selling it in the fourth quarter and ramp up output at a pace that would be slower than planned.
The stripped-down version is designed to be roughly 20% cheaper to produce than the refreshed Model Y and could scale to about 250,000 units a year in the U.S. by 2026.
Wall Street expects Tesla's deliveries to jump next year to 1.85 million vehicles, with the cheaper model accounting for 155,610 units in 2026, according to Visible Alpha estimates.
""Tesla is teasing something big as a flurry of X posts has fans bracing for what looks like the launch of a more affordable Model Y tomorrow,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally owns Tesla shares.
""The price tag will be the real tell, offering clues on how far Tesla has pushed cost savings and how much new demand it can unlock.""
The company has not introduced a new mass-market vehicle in years, relying heavily on incremental updates to the Model 3 and Model Y to drive sales.
Sales of its last major launch, the Cybertruck, have struggled, with Tesla offering thousands of dollars in discounts for vehicles in inventory in the past few months.
A U.S. recall filing in March showed 46,096 Cybertrucks had been built between its introduction in November 2023 and early this year.

Shares in Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA) slumped in Tuesday morning trading after the electric vehicle maker revealed that its new product, hinted at in a series of cryptic posts on X on Sunday, is a stripped-down and cheaper version of its Model Y SUV.
Tesla shares gained more than 5.4% by the closing bell on Monday after the EV maker posted gifs on Sunday of a spinning company logo with the date ""10/7"" and of what appeared to be car headlights shining through smoke.
The stock moved down by more than 1% in the first hour after Tuesday's opening bell.
The stripped-down Model Y — which will ""lack certain features and use less premium materials to offset the loss of the up to $7,500 federal tax credit,"" according to Bloomberg — is the first major product announcement since October 2024, when Telsa unveiled its self-driving ""Robotaxi.""
The new Model Y unveiling comes after another positive development for the electric vehicle maker. On Oct. 2, Tesla reported that EV deliveries in the three months through September had jumped by 7% over the same period last year and beat Wall Street expectations.
The deliveries gains have been at least partially attributed by analysts to the expiry at the end of September of the federal electric vehicle tax credit. Rival EV makers such as Rivian (RIVN) also posted heightened figures for the period.
Deliveries for Teslas suffered throughout the first half of 2025 as Musk spent much of his time in Washington, embroiled in on-again, off-again politics with the Trump administration. Deliveries for the first and second quarters of 2025 were down roughly 13% and 13.4% year over year, respectively, according to Tesla disclosures.
Tesla is set to report earnings on Oct. 22, with the company's annual shareholder meeting to follow on Nov. 6.

Chicago, IL – October 6, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla TSLA, Ford F and General Motors GM.
Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:
Tesla Q3 Deliveries Reach Record Levels: Is Tesla Stock a Buy?
Tesladelivered 497,099 electric vehicles (EVs) in the third quarter of 2025, up 7.4% year over year and surpassing our estimate of 435,370 units. Deliveries included 481,166 Model 3/Y and 15,933 other vehicles, marking the highest quarterly total in the company's history. With the $7,500 EV tax credit expiration at the end of September, many customers likely rushed to purchase vehicles to take advantage of the incentive, fueling third-quarter demand.
It wasn't just Tesla that benefited from this ""pull forward"" effect. Auto giants like Ford and General Motors also logged record EV sales for three months ending September. Ford's EV sales surged more than 30%, while GM more than doubled its tally.
With that being the general momentum across the broader industry, the key question is whether it is wise to buy Tesla stock now?
Tesla Europe and China Sales Dynamics
While Tesla doesn't officially break down sales by region, the third-quarter jump likely came from the United States. In Europe, however, the company has been facing weakening demand amid intensifying competition from both legacy automakers and Chinese EV players, alongside a backlash tied to Elon Musk's political activities. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that Tesla sold 8,220 vehicles in the EU in August, down about 37% year over year, as cited by Yahoo Finance.
China presents a slightly better picture. According to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), Tesla's August deliveries declined 9.9% year over year but climbed more than 40% from July, per CnEVPost. Between January and August, Tesla only posted year-over-year growth in March and June but September is expected to be stronger. In August, Tesla also launched the Model Y L — a stretched, six-seat version of its popular SUV designed for Chinese families seeking larger vehicles. The new variant is anticipated to help reignite demand in the region.
TSLA's Energy Business is Strong
Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage business continues to grow rapidly, driven by strong demand for Megapack and Powerwall products. This segment now delivers the company's highest margins. Tesla deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage products in the third quarter of 2025, setting a new quarterly record."

These players are Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla. As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom accelerated and the environment for growth stocks strengthened, investors piled into all seven -- they're each well-established and profitable and offer exciting long-term prospects.
While they all are great stocks to own, though, two in particular stand out right now. That's because, in addition to offering you fantastic businesses and growth, they also are trading at very interesting valuations. In fact, they're the two cheapest of the Magnificent Seven and represent screaming buys today. Let's zoom in for a closer look.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet is most known for its Google Search platform, since most of us use it every day. Google Search has dominated the market for years, steadily holding about 90% share, and that's likely to continue thanks to Alphabet's focus on AI. The company is using this technology to make search better than ever -- and improve the advertising experience for advertisers. This is key because advertising makes up most of the company's revenue, so making these customers happy should keep them coming back and spending more.
On top of this, Alphabet also operates another growth business, and that's Google Cloud. This unit has delivered quarter after quarter of double-digit growth, and in the recent period, revenue topped $13 billion. Growth potential is big because Google Cloud is well positioned to benefit from AI demand -- Alphabet has developed its own large language model (LLM) and is using it to power various products and services available through its cloud unit. And Google Cloud also offers access to a variety of other top AI products, such as Nvidia's high-performance AI chips.
Another reason to be bullish on Alphabet is a recent court ruling in a U.S. antitrust case against the company eliminated the worst-case scenario -- a possible breakup of Google -- so Alphabet remains on track for growth.
All of this makes the stock look dirt cheap at only 21x forward earnings estimates.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms' big business is social media as it owns the world's most recognizable and popular apps -- Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. In fact, 3.4 billion people use at least one of those apps on a daily basis.
But Meta isn't just a social media company and is instead building itself into an AI giant. The company has created its own LLM and has kept some of its AI work open source, a move that could help Meta stand out as a leader as AI develops. This tech giant is using its AI strengths to keep users on its apps longer, thanks to its AI assistant, and to help advertisers, its main source of revenue, improve their campaigns. The company also aims to grow through the development and sales of AI devices, such as its AI glasses.
Meta already has increased earnings into the billions of dollars over time, and in the recent quarter, announced double-digit gains in revenue and net income -- sales reached $47 billion, while net income rose to $18 billion. All of this along with a cash position of $47 billion mean the company has what it takes to pursue this AI investment and potentially win.
Meanwhile, the company also is sharing the wealth with shareholders through and dividends -- Meta paid out $1.33 billion in dividends in the recent quarter.
Today, Meta stock trades for 25x forward earnings estimates, making it the second-cheapest of the Magnificent Seven after Alphabet and a screaming buy, considering its performance so far and its ability to stand out in the AI revolution."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-05T23:05:00,The EV Tax Credit Just Expired -- 3 Stocks That Could Still Win Without It,Not all EV makers will be crushed by the expiring sales incentive.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=17bfda8386544e8f45cddbc1d8273ed123342eaae3d4f5f68121ef18f10b3095,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/the-ev-tax-credit-just-expired-3-stocks-that-could/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/the-ev-tax-credit-just-expired-3-stocks-that-could/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/the-ev-tax-credit-just-expired-3-stocks-that-could/,fool.com,200,,"The $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit is no more.
It expired at midnight on Tuesday night, and the U.S. auto industry is bracing for a slump in demand. Without the additional $7,500 to make EVs more affordable, Ford (F 0.86%) CEO Jim Farley expects that demand for the battery-powered vehicles will be cut in half.
But it's not all bad news for automakers, even EV makers. Here are three stocks of EV manufacturers that could still succeed without the government incentives.
The EV maker that's not priced like one
Even without additional tax incentives, Tesla's (TSLA 1.39%) stock could still be a winner.
That's because shares of the world's largest EV manufacturer seem largely immune to sales declines. In first-quarter 2025, the company delivered 336,681 vehicles, a 13% year-over-year decline (and its first year-over-year delivery decline ever). In second-quarter 2025, the year-over-year decline was even worse, with 384,122 vehicle deliveries, down 13.5% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, its latest release, the Cybertruck, represents a minimal number of those sales (fewer than 10,000 each quarter). In spite of that, the company's shares are up 14% year to date, and its valuation hasn't suffered at all.
The company's trailing price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 17.4 is orders of magnitude higher than automakers that sell millions of cars each quarter. That includes Toyota (TM 1.35%), which trades at 0.78x trailing sales, and Volkswagen (VWAGY -0.09%), which trades at a minuscule 0.16x. In fact, Tesla's P/S ratio today is even higher than its five-year average of 13.4x.
Tesla's stock price resilience even in the face of sales declines likely indicates that investors are placing more value on the company's bets on future technologies, like self-driving robotaxis and autonomous humanoid robots, than on its continued dominance in the now-crowded electric vehicle market. Sales declines resulting from a loss of the tax credit are unlikely to change that pattern.
The EV maker that can't be affected
Electric vehicle maker Nio (NIO 0.44%) won't lose a single sale because of the tax credit expiration. That's because it doesn't sell its cars in the U.S. to begin with.
Nio is one of the Chinese electric vehicle makers founded by William Li, and the bulk of its sales are in its native China, but it is starting to sell its vehicles in European markets as well. It's already established sales and service networks in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and just announced plans to expand into seven additional European countries, including Austria and Poland.
Because demand for EVs is stronger in China and Europe than in the U.S., Nio has a distinct advantage over companies for which the U.S. is their largest market. Additionally, Nio has been aggressively competing with its rivals on price. It's offering its new Onvo L90 electric SUV for just $37,000, or a mere $25,000 with a subscription to its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) plan. This plan allows users to swap out depleted battery packs for full ones without needing to wait for them to charge.
That's a competitive price on an in-demand model without any tax credit required.
The EV maker that barely makes EVs
Of all the major car companies, Toyota was perhaps the most reluctant to offer all-electric models. It preferred to double down on its successful hybrid technology, which is now available across most of its vehicle lineup. In fact, the latest models of the Toyota Sienna minivan and the Camry sedan are hybrid-only in the U.S. market. Hybrid vehicles were never eligible for the EV tax credit, so the bulk of Toyota's lineup should be unaffected.
Toyota did eventually enter the U.S. EV market in late 2022 with its bZ SUV, but it's sold only about 35,000 of them in the U.S. since then, including 18,570 in 2024. Because they were manufactured in Japan, however, they only qualified for the tax credit if they were leased and not bought. Toyota has announced plans to ramp up its U.S. EV manufacturing capacity by manufacturing two fully electric three-row SUVs at its massive Kentucky plant. Slumping U.S. EV sales could complicate that plan, but in terms of existing sales, the company will barely be affected by the tax credit expiration at all.
Toyota's share price is down slightly year to date, in contrast to most other major automaker stocks. It also sports a 3.2% dividend yield, making it a comparatively safe bet for capital preservation in an uncertain industry."

With a combination of record quarterly deliveries, a sharp sell-off, and an earnings report on the horizon, it's a good time to look closely at the growth stock. Is the pullback a buying opportunity?
The electric vehicle (EV) maker, which also sells batteries and energy-storage systems and is increasingly leaning into software and services with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) driver-assistance technology and its autonomous ride-sharing robotaxi operation, has some massive catalysts ahead. But it may have to endure a tough fourth quarter first, making the question of whether shares are a buy a difficult one. The stock's high valuation makes the decision even harder.
With this backdrop in mind, here are four reasons investors might want to buy the stock and one important reason they may want to avoid it.
A return to growth in its core automotive business
Tesla delivered about 497,100 vehicles in the third quarter, a new quarterly record and, importantly, a return to year-over-year growth of about 7% versus the same period last year. That reversal follows two straight quarters of declines: First-quarter 2025 deliveries fell 13% year over year to 336,681, and second-quarter 2025 deliveries slipped 13% to 384,122. Together, these figures frame Q3 not just as a huge sequential jump but also as a clear break in a tough 2025 trend.
Even though the rebound was helped by the expiration of a key $7,500 U.S. electric vehicle credit, it's worth noting that third-quarter deliveries were far above analysts' consensus forecast for only about 448,000 vehicles.
Energy is quietly becoming a substantial catalyst
Alongside vehicles, Tesla's fast-growing energy storage business took another major step forward in Q3. Tesla deployed 12.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) of storage in the third quarter, its highest on record and well above both the 9.6 GWh reported in the second quarter of 2025 and the 6.9 GWh posted in the third quarter of 2024.
This key segment is now generating substantial gross profit for the company and is likely to continue growing as a percentage of overall revenue.
Fading credits may sting, but product and pricing help
The $7,500 federal electric vehicle credit expired on Sept. 30 -- a change that likely pulled some U.S. demand into Q3 and could weigh on Q4. But there are two offsets worth watching. First, Tesla's sweeping post-COVID-19 price cuts have made its lineup far more accessible than a few years ago.
Second, the recently overhauled Model Y, which Tesla is calling Juniper, gives the company a timely hero product to market into the holidays. While these may not be enough to fully offset the loss of the electric vehicle incentive, they are key catalysts that can help the company begin building momentum going into 2026.
A more affordable model is coming
More importantly, the company has a more affordable model coming soon. Indeed, Tesla said in its second-quarter update that it produced its first units of the new model in June, with volume production planned before the year ends. While comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the company's second-quarter earnings call suggest this may simply be a cheaper version of the new Model Y, it's still worth getting excited about. A lower-priced car could help offset the loss of the now-expired federal credit.
If the company releases a meaningfully lower-priced model with a compelling range and features, the addition could significantly expand Tesla's addressable market next year.
A new, higher-margin revenue stream
And don't forget what is probably Tesla's most important catalyst: a recently launched limited robotaxi pilot program in Austin. It is early for the autonomous ride-sharing program, and a cautious rollout and regulatory constraints mean the near-term financial impact is likely small, but this could morph into a major profit stream for Tesla over time.
If the service scales and more owners opt into Full Self-Driving (Supervised), software and services could grow as a share of revenue. This will likely be a positive for margins and valuation over time. Additionally, growing buzz about robotaxi and Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software could help lure in new Tesla buyers, helping accelerate sales growth.
The reason not to buy? Valuation still leaves little room for error
Even after the sell-off, the stock trades at more than 250 times earnings as of this writing. A price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio like this makes the S&P 500's P/E of about 26 look cheap -- and it leaves almost no room for error. The valuation arguably already prices in substantial progress on autonomy, software monetization, and lower-priced vehicles while also expecting energy to keep compounding. Ultimately, shares could take a beating if Tesla drops the ball in any way.
Despite the company's powerful catalysts, the bear case (valuation) is simpler and, for now, heavy enough to matter. Considering all these bullish reasons to buy shares in the context of the stock's high valuation, investors should proceed with caution. For investors convinced by Tesla's long-term roadmap, a small position could make sense with the expectation of volatility and the discipline to add only if shares retreat further.

One made the wrong choice.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=925f0588c5df60028ceb42eedd1124cfb3fd0a5bac295d04411ced5c72d5a3b4,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/rivian-vs-lucid-which-ev-stock-is-winning-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/rivian-vs-lucid-which-ev-stock-is-winning-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/rivian-vs-lucid-which-ev-stock-is-winning-in-2025/,fool.com,200,,"Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.17%) and Lucid Group (LCID -1.23%) were two start-up electric vehicle (EV) companies with plenty of potential several years ago. The world was in the midst of an EV cycle as many early adopters scooped up Tesla's leading EV offerings and others looked for alternatives.
Rivian and Lucid focused on different consumer markets. Lucid's luxury Air sedan boasted leading battery range and performance technology. That came with a high price tag, though, leaving only wealthy consumers as the target. Rivian began to offer what Tesla didn't -- electric pickup trucks and a large SUV.
Tesla is no longer the only game in town for EV buyers. Yet neither Rivian nor Lucid are sure to have sustainable success. One EV maker looks to have a much clearer path to profitability, though.
Lucid still just caters to high-end buyers
With a 2026 model year Lucid Air sedan starting at a price north of $70,000, it's clear that it won't be a mass-market EV. Lucid even offers a fully equipped Sapphire model for $249,000. On the surface, that might seem like a losing proposition for investors, but it's a business model that worked for Tesla. Tesla's idea was to begin to sell a relatively low volume of the Model S luxury sedan and its luxury Model X SUV to show off its EV technology and grow a core following.
Tesla pivoted to the more affordable Models Y and 3, for which it ramped up production quickly. That led to soaring global sales. Consider that Tesla produced over 500,000 EVs in 2020, the year it began selling the popular Model Y. Lucid began selling its Gravity SUV this year and still only expects production of between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles in 2025. A lower-priced model is scheduled for release late this year, but even that Touring model will be priced at close to $80,000.
The slow ramp of selling volume helps explain why Lucid stock has struggled. The company has talked about future plans for more affordable models, but it may be taking too long to get there. Lucid continues to bleed cash with a loss from operations of about $1.5 billion in the first half of 2025.
Lucid can manage those losses for now. It has financial backing from its largest shareholder, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. It also recently announced the closing of a $300 million investment from Uber Technologies. The two companies will partner for a premium global robotaxi program that will also help boost Lucid sales beyond its direct consumers.
Rivian looks to boost sales quickly
Rivian is doing things differently. First, it targeted a market in which Tesla doesn't participate. Its R1T electric pickup truck was unique when it launched. The R1S SUV was larger than Tesla's Model Y, and engineered more for off-road adventure. Most importantly, Rivian will begin selling a next-generation R2 SUV next year. The R2 is modestly priced, starting at $45,000.
Rivian also has strong financial backing. Volkswagen Group made a $1 billion equity investment in June. That was part of a prior agreement and was triggered by Rivian posting its second quarterly period of positive gross profit in Q1. As of the end of June, Rivian had about $7.5 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet.
Rivian expects to start deliveries of the R2 in the first half of 2026. While production levels will be relatively flat year over year in 2025, next year could be pivotal for Rivian. Manufacturing is being impacted this fall as the company increases annual production capacity of its Illinois factory to approximately 215,000 units.
There's no guarantee that the R2 and subsequent smaller R3 will be commercial successes. If those vehicles do sell well, though, Rivian will be on a path to profitability. That makes it a better stock than Lucid to own in 2025."

More than a month ago, I asked you, dear reader, how you thought EV sales would play out once the $7,500 federal tax credit expired on September 30. The majority of those who responded to the poll predicted that EV sales would fall off a cliff.
Now, it’s too early to tell yet; we are just a few days past the end of the quarter. But the expiring tax credit did give many automakers a bit of a sales bump as consumers raced to buy EVs before the deadline.
Tesla, which has seen sales growth diminish, just registered its best quarter of deliveries ever at 497,099 vehicles. That’s a massive 29% jump from the second quarter, about a 7% increase over the same period last year, and more than it has ever delivered in a single quarter.
Ford Motor, General Motors, and Hyundai also reported record quarterly sales of EVs. Rivian saw deliveries jump to 13,201 vehicles, up from 10,661 and 8,640 in the second and first quarters, respectively.
The looming question is how will automakers navigate a possible slowdown in EV sales in this post-tax credit era? Rivian has already adjusted its guidance down for 2025. Others may follow.
The crux for automakers is how to get rid of inventory as the new 2026 models come in without reducing or eliminating profit margins (and in some cases deepening the losses)?
A little bird
The Department of Energy canceled 321 clean energy projects but wasn’t sharing the details with TechCrunch or the public. Luckily, a little bird shared the complete list of awards the Trump administration had canceled, and the results were revealing.
Altogether, the canceled awards totaled $7.56 billion, with California bearing the brunt, losing $2.2 billion worth of grants, including a $630 million grid-modernization program that could have become a template for the nation. Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Oregon rounded out the top eight, losing between $300 million and $600 million each.
It wasn’t until farther down the list that a red state popped up. Indeed, the majority of projects were sited in states that had voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, something many media outlets reported after Office of Management and Budget chief Russell Vought tweeted as much.
But even in blue states, some awards stuck, possibly due to political connections with the Trump administration or aligned interests. Whatever the case, the move by the DOE suggests the government might be a less reliable partner for businesses, especially small startups."

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is one of the stocks Wall Street is watching.
Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures and former Tesla president, said in a recent program on CNBC that the demand for EVs may decline following the end of subsidies but rebound in the long term.
“Demand is continuing to increase around the world. When I land in Tel Aviv, I see a lot of EVs, a lot of Chinese EVs. When I land in Mexico City, I see a lot of EVs and a lot of Chinese EVs. And certainly when you land in China, you see almost every car is an EV, but same thing in Norway. And the reason for that is these cars are a lot less energy cost, a lot less maintenance cost, and they’re super fun to drive because the weight of the center of gravity is actually in the center of the vehicle for the first time.”
Asked what names he’d own, the analyst mentioned General Motors and highlighted the company’s EV business:
“GM has come from the bottom of the charts now to the top of the charts and is the number one or number two player in the US. They’ve created a company several times the size of Rivian just in a few years. And so I wouldn’t rule out the US players, especially GM either. Like the GM released the Chevy Equinox and that is right around the $30,000 price point and that has shown that there is a mass market for these. They’re introducing the Bolt EV, the Bolt 2, early next year. And that’ll be another entry into that price segment. And so I think what they’re seeing is that yeah, there’s demand at that price point for sure.”

Hotchkis & Wiley Large Cap Fundamental Value Fund stated the following regarding General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) reported strong Q3 earnings results and improved free cash flow guidance. We like GM for many reasons. First, we believe GM has leading market positions in its main business segments. Second, the valuation is extremely attractive. Finally, we believe it is a strong free cash flow generator, and the management team is committed to repurchasing their undervalued shares.”
While we acknowledge the potential of GM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Imagine a future where the biggest US stocks like Tesla (TSLA) or Nvidia (NVDA) can be traded around the clock, with the transactions settled in seconds.
Momentum is building toward that vision. The crypto industry, along with Wall Street heavyweights, wants to bring tokenized stocks, or digital versions of traditional shares that are recorded on a blockchain's digital ledger, into the mainstream.
Last month Nasdaq (NDAQ) asked regulators for permission to allow listed stocks to trade in tokenized form on its exchange. If the request is granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it would mark a pivotal step toward merging traditional finance with blockchain. The SEC opened the proposal for public comments in September, with a decision expected within 45 to 90 days of publication.
“Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Robinhood (HOOD) CEO Vlad Tenev said at a crypto conference in Singapore on Wednesday. Over the summer, the trading platform launched more than 200 US stock and ETF (exchange-traded fund) tokens in Europe.
Meanwhile, Wall Street firms ranging from Goldman Sachs to asset manager BlackRock have already rolled out tokenized money-market funds. BlackRock is also reportedly exploring the launch of tokenized ETFs.
""Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,"" BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said in the company's annual newsletter in July. ""Markets wouldn't need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds.""
Supporters argue that tokenized stocks make trading more accessible to investors, enable exchanges of assets in just one blockchain transaction, and expand their use in lending or as collateral.
“These are financial tools that the retail investor is not used to,” said Kevin Rusher, founder of real-world asset borrowing and lending firm RAAC. ""It lowers the barrier to entry.""
The market for tokenized real-world assets, which include stablecoins, bonds, real estate, and commodities, could swell from about $600 billion in 2025 to nearly $19 trillion by 2033, according to Boston Consulting Group and Ripple.
The rollout of some tokenized equity products abroad have had a rocky start.
Tokens tracking popular stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) in Europe have struggled with thin liquidity, leading to prices diverging from those of actual stocks.
Concerns about third-party issuers have also surfaced."

And one of Musk’s latest actions has brought it back into the spotlight. Here’s a look at Tesla’s 2025, including Musk’s recent move and how it could impact investors.
Tesla’s Rocky 2025
As CNN reported, Tesla shares almost doubled after the November 2024 presidential election win of Donald Trump, as Musk’s close friendship and support of then President-elect Trump indicated a promising future for the company.
However, following record highs in December 2024, Tesla’s stock price quickly cratered by March 2025. The reason? Both Tesla and Musk himself suffered significant backlash related to Musk’s controversial involvement in politics and DOGE.
In fact, Tesla incurred its most precipitous sales drop ever in its first and second quarters of 2025, per CNN.

Musk’s Latest Move
That said, while Musk’s political leanings may have had a negative impact on the Tesla brand this year, his incredible wealth has also come to the company’s rescue.
Musk is the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $488.1 billion as of Oct. 3, 2025, meaning that he could rather easily afford to spend $1 billion of his own personal wealth to purchase additional shares of Tesla stock — which is exactly what he did in September 2025.
While a CEO using their own money to buy up their own company’ stock (without utilizing stock options) is rare, well, so is Musk’s wealth. As CNN reported, the move greatly helped the somewhat ailing auto manufacturer.
News of Musk’s purchase helped boost Tesla shares by an overall 4%, which eradicated Tesla’s tough stock losses of late. As Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities put it, the move “sends a positive signal after a very tumultuous year for Musk and Tesla shareholders.”
What Does It Mean for Investors?
Musk’s noteworthy investment shows stockholders the high degree of confidence he has in Tesla’s brand and future — and will likely continue to inspire others to follow his investment lead. As a result, Tesla investors could expect the slight but healthy increase in Tesla’s valuation to continue.
Further, the $7,500 tax credit for American EV buyers came to an end on Sept. 30, which was expected to increase sales of Tesla vehicles prior to the tax credit cutoff. In fact, The New York Times reported that its sales climbed 7% as the credit was approaching its end. That sales spike could provide a boost to third quarter Tesla numbers, providing additional gains to the EV automaker’s stock worth."

On Thursday, the three major indexes — the S&P 500, Dow, and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) — all hit fresh records.
Friday saw a continued strong performance as the Dow hit 47,000 for the first time ever and both the Dow and the S&P closed at record highs. The Nasdaq notched a slight pullback after shares in Tesla (TSLA) fell through Friday's trading session.
Strong performance in a shutdown isn't without precedent. In every shutdown since 1995, the S&P 500 has notched positive performance, according to data from LPL Financial.
""Investors have generally looked past budget-related disruptions, prioritizing corporate earnings, broader economic trends, and other key macroeconomic factors,"" LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist said in an email."

At least that's what certain experts think. ""Next year could be a pretty dreadful year for EVs in this country,"" warns Adam Jonas, an analyst for Morgan Stanley. Tesla is already struggling with sluggish sales growth. But as we'll see, meager sales growth could get even worse starting this week.
Expect EV demand to drop sharply starting this week
Why is Adam Jonas so bearish on EVs in 2026? Last month, tax credits for EV buyers were eliminated. That essentially adds up to $7,500 to the price tag of most EV purchases. Don't underestimate the upcoming impact. While more consumers are interested in an EV for their next vehicle purchase, these consumers are also increasingly cost conscious. According to Eric Bradlow, an expert on EV demand at The Wharton School, ""consumers considering an EV or hybrid are more pragmatic and cost-conscious than current EV owners.""
Due to social pushback against its mercurial CEO, Elon Musk, as well as a relatively stale product lineup, Tesla is already struggling to maintain positive sales growth. Revenue is expected to fall by nearly 5% this fiscal year. Next year, however, sales are expected to grow by nearly 20%. If experts like Eric Bradlow and Adam Jonas are correct, however, Tesla's actual results in 2026 could disappoint.
Investors should be prepared for lumpy sales results. Prospective EV buyers may have accelerated their purchase plans in order to take advantage of tax incentives before they expired in September. This could make next quarter's results look promising. But investors should expect a steep drop-off in sales in the quarters to follow."

But Smith had started getting antsy around 2016, as he was approaching three decades at the company, Axon compensation committee chair Hadi Partovi told Fortune. Smith was talking more seriously to the board about his succession plan, who was next to lead the company, and what he would do next. Partovi knew Smith could make a lot more money if he launched a startup than if he made Axon worth 10 times as much under his previous comp plan.
“This is when I realized we had a real problem,” said Partovi.
Smith thrives in high-risk, high-reward environments, so the Axon board granted Smith a near carbon copy of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s moonshot pay plan but on a much smaller scale. The challenge to Smith was to grow the Taser stun gun and body-camera maker 10-fold over a 10-year performance period starting in 2018. From a base of $2.5 billion, Smith had to increase the company’s market cap by $1 billion to unlock each new tranche of stock options, for a total of 12 tranches and a market cap of $13.5 billion. In addition, Smith had to hit eight revenue-based operational or eight adjusted-Ebitda-based goals. During the decade he was supposed to work on achieving those goals, he would get almost nothing—no bonuses or other incentives, and his salary was about $31,000 a year.
“In full candor, my wife was against me taking on the challenge, as she saw it as just too risky,” Smith wrote in a letter to investors in 2023. But Smith blew through all the goals and each of the 12 tranches in five years—half the time the board gave him—making Smith the highest-paid CEO last year with compensation valued at $165 million. The stock price grew more than 600% between 2018 when the board offered him the moonshot and 2023. After he unlocked the 12th tranche, Smith negotiated an $88 million reduction on his next performance plan (which will keep him at Axon until at least 2030 with a goal of driving the stock to $943.75) and directed it be granted to the lowest-paid workers at Axon, showering them with surprise stock grants based on their years of tenure at the company.
“The best is yet to come,” Smith wrote to investors in his letter this year.
What is a moonshot pay package?
Smith shooting the moon—twice, potentially—represents a resurgent breed of executive compensation that has captured the imaginations of a growing number of CEOs. Moonshot wanderlust initially kicked into high gear after Elon Musk’s groundbreaking 2017 award from Tesla, once valued as high as $56 billion before it was twice rescinded owing to a legal challenge. Moonshot grants, not to be confused with an outsize stock grant known as a “mega grant” for its sheer size, tie CEO compensation almost entirely to aggressive, seemingly impossible performance targets, explained Eric Hoffmann, vice president and chief data officer at comp consulting firm Farient Advisors. CEOs don’t get the awards unless they hit specific valuation hurdles and operational goals, he said, and the performance periods are typically five, seven or 10 years, rather than the more standard three-year period."

And as we see consumers maybe become a bit more choosy about the types of cars that they're purchasing for both gas-powered cars along with EVs. What's the used car market been like? And and how does that compare to some of these newer vehicles on the market?
Well, one thing we know is that electric cars tend to depreciate very rapidly. So whenever you see analysis of the cost to own, factor in initial purchase price and depreciation. The good news for consumers is that if you're looking for an electric car, a used electric car will be an amazing bargain. Like they are really competitive in terms of pricing. But at the same time, you get lots of compelling features and you get lots of cool safety equipment. So it can work out for consumers if they're looking for a good used electric car.
And finally, for shoppers looking to buy or trade in, end of year is usually that time that we see the most deals, the more the most tax incentives. Is that still the case this time around or did that playbook change a bit with the expiration of these tax credits?
I I think there's a there's several things putting pressure on that. Of course, you're going to see a little bit of that. It's going to be model by model, not brand by brand. But the two things that we're seeing is the expiration of the incentives plus tariffs. All of those things could have the potential to make the 2026 cars more expensive so that you may be able to get a discount on the 2025, but that's probably it. Going forward, not every automaker can afford to absorb the tariffs as many are doing right now.
All right, Brian, a lot to think about as we head towards the end of the year. Appreciate it. Thanks so much.
Thanks."

In recent years, however, several high-profile executives have also started embracing digital assets.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has frequently joked about Dogecoin, while Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has consistently voiced strong optimism around Bitcoin (BTC -1.98%). Another corporate leader who has gone even further is Strategy co-founder, Michael Saylor.
Saylor has become one of the most outspoken Bitcoin advocates, going as far as to add the cryptocurrency directly to Strategy's balance sheet. More recently, he projected a long-term price target of $21 million per coin by 2046. For perspective, that represents more than 18,000% upside from Bitcoin's current price of roughly $114,000 as of this writing.
The question, then, is what underpins Saylor's extraordinary bullish outlook -- and how realistic is such a forecast? Let's examine the core drivers of Saylor's thesis and consider whether this path is truly feasible.
Michael Saylor and the power of 21
In June, Saylor spoke at a Bitcoin seminar in Prague, where he outlined 21 principles for building wealth -- many of which, unsurprisingly, touched on Bitcoin.
One of his core themes was the idea of scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, Bitcoin's supply is permanently capped at 21 million coins. This hard limit creates a unique supply-and-demand dynamic: During periods of economic uncertainty, investors are more likely to seek out Bitcoin as a store of value or even a hedge against inflation.
Saylor also contends that the growing tokenization of traditional asset classes on the blockchain will accelerate institutional adoption of Bitcoin. He takes this a step further, pointing to recent developments such as the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs by major financial institutions as well as the emergence of sovereign interest, with some nations already building -- or actively considering -- strategic Bitcoin reserves.
Understanding the math behind $21 million per Bitcoin
If Bitcoin were to reach $21 million per coin, its implied market capitalization would be about $441 trillion.
To put this into perspective, global gross domestic product (GDP) currently stands at about $111 trillion. Even assuming steady annual growth of 2.5%, worldwide GDP would only expand to roughly $186 trillion by 2046 -- less than half of Bitcoin's projected market value under Saylor's forecast.
For Bitcoin to reach this price target, its value would need to compound at an average annual rate of about 28% over the next two decades. This growth is nearly four times the long-term compounded return of the S&P 500.
Will Bitcoin reach $21 million by 2046?
Based on the analysis above, I view Saylor's model as overly aggressive and think his $21 million target serves best as a thought experiment. That said, his broader bullish perspective shouldn't be dismissed. The strength of his argument is not supported by an exact dollar figure; rather, it lies in the directional insight.
While Saylor's projected price appreciation is unlikely to be realized literally, he does a great job of underscoring the asymmetric nature of Bitcoin: a strictly fixed supply set against the possibility of expanding demand. If institutional investors and governments continue to adopt Bitcoin, its value could rise far more sharply than many skeptics anticipate.
For investors, the takeaway is to separate vision from probability. Saylor may be overstating the magnitude, but he is likely correct about the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin. For this reason, I see exposure to Bitcoin as a good idea for investors with a long-term time horizon and a willingness to accept pronounced volatility as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve."

On the one hand, there are strong supporters who are convinced that founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk will one day usher in a new world of self-driving cars and robotics. On the other hand, the bears will point to deteriorating financials that reveal a struggling automaker.
Whichever way you view the business, no one can deny that Tesla has worked out to be a wonderful investment. The electric vehicle (EV) stock has soared 2,580% during the past decade (as of Sept. 29), trouncing the overall market by a wide margin. But perhaps the market is getting too excited, as the business sports a market cap of $1.5 trillion.
Long-term investors have a lot to think about. Where will Tesla be in 10 years?
Smooth journey to unrivaled success
Making accurate predictions is extremely difficult to begin with. But trying to figure out what a business, one that operates in quickly evolving markets, will look like a decade from now seems impossible. Despite this challenge, the most optimistic outcome for Tesla is very clear.
Musk is pressing the gas pedal hard in two key areas: full self-driving (FSD) and robotics. The business is making progress with FSD capabilities, although it's years behind Musk's timetable. Tesla finally launched its robo-taxi service in Austin, Texas, in June. Including Texas and California, it will soon test them in Nevada and Arizona.
""Assuming we have regulatory approvals, it's probably addressing half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year,"" Musk said about the robo-taxi service on the Q2 2025 earnings call.
The ultimate goal is to have a ride-hailing platform, similar to Uber or Lyft, operating around the globe. The difference would be that Tesla controls the manufacturing of the EVs, with the cars also being completely autonomous. Costs for riders would drop significantly, boosting demand. This would theoretically be a financial boon for Tesla.
Additionally, Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus could be in homes and factories around the world by 2035. Tesla still needs to scale up manufacturing. Musk wants to produce 1 million units annually within five years. He thinks the use cases are unlimited, with a view that robotics could bring in $10 trillion in revenue.
If Tesla makes good on FSD and robotics promises, and there proves to be tremendous demand, then it's anyone's guess what the business looks like 10 years from now. Assuming flawless execution, coupled with external factors working in Tesla's favor, the company's market cap could be multiples of the current value. And shareholders would be beyond pleased.
Recent financial performance
It might be difficult for investors to envision the most optimistic 2035 version of Tesla. That's because at this point, this is a troubled car company. Automotive revenue declined 16% in Q2, while operating income fell 42%. Competition is partly having an impact.
However, recent financials have shown that the business is not immune to economic forces. This is the biggest risk of investing in car companies, as consumer demand changes with the macro winds, particularly interest rates.
Somewhere in the middle
Getting the robo-taxi service off the ground, while working to expand manufacturing capacity for robots, is certainly progress. However, Tesla has a long way to go to fulfill Musk's vision. It's not a sure thing that the business will dominate in these areas a decade from now. So, if the just-mentioned pessimistic view is the reality, then Tesla shareholders are in for a disappointing decade.
The valuation points to a decent likelihood that the business will find outsized success with its two key projects, FSD tech and robotics. But nothing is guaranteed. And the shares trade at a stratospheric forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 265.
Perhaps the Tesla of 2035 will be somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. Either way, the stock provides no margin of safety right now."

On the one hand, the company is dealing with a talent exodus with multiple executives leaving, consumer backlash at CEO Elon Musk's political antics, declining global sales, and an aging vehicle lineup, just to name a few.
On the other hand, the company believes it can be the most valuable company in the world as it transitions from vehicle production to a company based on artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and driverless vehicles. The question remains: Where will Tesla's stock trade during all of this madness?
Falling behind?
One of the biggest developments for Tesla investors over the summer happened in Austin, Texas, where the company launched its robotaxi pilot. However, three months into its robotaxi pilot with a small number of Model Ys operating, it still requires a safety driver just in case, and it still only operates with invite-only passengers.
Sure, it was a step forward after the company had long promised such a service, but Tesla is still behind its primary rival, Waymo, which is moving into new cities and doesn't require a safety driver to supervise its driverless vehicle.
While the slower and smaller initial test may have made investors cautious, Musk remains ambitious. During Tesla's July 23 earnings call, he noted that the autonomous ride-hailing service would reach across most of the country and ""probably"" address half the U.S. population by the end of 2025 -- lofty targets, to be sure.
No small matter
Make no mistake, this is a huge development for investors and the stakes are high. Tesla's slow rollout has some onlookers pumping the brakes.
""It's an acknowledgment that their software isn't as mature as they thought it was and they're going to need more time with a safety driver,"" said Carnegie Mellon professor Philip Koopman, an expert in autonomous vehicle safety, according to Automotive News. ""That's OK for everyone except the people who invested thinking there'd be a million of these cars on the road by the end of the year,"" he said.
Investors looking for a silver lining might have to squint to see it more clearly, but it's there. One reason Tesla remains a serious threat to its rivals such as Waymo is because once the autonomous technology and robotaxi become fully autonomous, the automaker can easily produce tons of vehicles from its factories in California and Texas.
Long term, Tesla's gigafactory production is an advantage. But the company also has a cost advantage over its rivals as it only uses cameras for its self-driving technology, rather than more expensive sensors such as radar and lidar.
Investors also have to keep in mind Tesla may be behind at the moment, but at the same time could make progress faster than its competitors. In fact, if Tesla can change to no safety driver in the next 12 months, that'll be faster than any other robotaxi company that's accomplished the feat. For context, Waymo tested for years with safety drivers before going fully autonomous, but that was back in 2020.
What it all means
Tesla's progress with autonomous vehicles has been slower than desired, but investors should focus on if the company can do it without sensors, and do it effectively. At this point doing it right is much more valuable than doing it faster -- that battle may already be over. That said, Tesla has seemingly gone all-in on its future transition from only producing vehicles to becoming an AI, robotics, and robotaxi service company, which could be lucrative if it's all achieved.
Until then, investors are going to need plenty of patience, especially considering the third quarter is likely to be strong -- remember the end of the $7,500 tax credit pulled demand into the third quarter. That should be followed by several rather bumpy quarters for not only Tesla but the broader electric vehicle industry."

His wealth, too, has continued to accrue. According to Forbes’ real-time billionaire’s list, Ellison is the second-richest man on Earth, pegged at a net worth of $349.5 billion as of Oct. 2. That ranking places him just below Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a notch above Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
But how, exactly, did Ellison accumulate such massive wealth?
Early Beginnings: Ellison as a Software Self-Starter
Described as a “classic rags-to-riches story” by CEO Today, Ellison was raised in Chicago by his aunt and uncle, and is noted as a two-time college dropout, first exiting the University of Illinois followed by the University of Chicago.
Nonetheless, he displayed a natural aptitude for programming and the attendant problem-solving and logic that accompanies the practice, and soon he joined up with tech companies such as Ampex and Amdahl.
While working for Ampex, Ellison ended up working on a project for the CIA (codenamed “Oracle”), which would end up being fuel for his own entrepreneurial fire.
In 1977, Ellison co-founded Software Development Laboratories, which would later assume the moniker of Oracle Corporation. Oracle would go on to be the brand behind some of the world’s most popular enterprise software offerings — notably, Oracle Database — and the rest is history.

Oracle Stock and Other Investments
While it’s undeniable that the vast bulk of Ellison’s wealth (and the growth thereof) is attributable to his holdings in Oracle — he holds about a 40% stake in the company, per Forbes — he also has investments in Tesla, real estate and other ventures.
Regarding the bulk of his investments, in Oracle, the company’s earnings results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2026 showed revenue growth of 12%. Plus, its share price has skyrocketed by more than 74% for the year as of Oct. 2. As a result, Ellison’s holdings have blossomed over time.
The lesson: Being a self-starter willing to teach yourself in-demand skill sets and leverage these into business pursuits could pay off big. While you may not make billions, it’s certainly a good place to begin if you’re looking to pursue long-term wealth-building."

Tesla is never just one story. This week alone, Elon Musk’s EV company reported deliveries of almost half-a-million cars, faced a wrongful-death lawsuit over a fiery Cybertruck crash, watched investors revolt against his trillion-dollar pay plan, and briefly sent Musk’s personal fortune into the half-trillion stratosphere.
Suggested Reading
Taken together, they sketch a company that can’t separate its triumphs from its troubles, where blowout deliveries share space with boardroom drama and safety probes. Tesla remains both the industry’s growth engine and its lightning rod, a business whose every success seems to summon new scrutiny. And for investors, customers, and regulators, the Tesla show is equal parts thrill ride and high-wire act.

Here’s how the week’s acts unfolded — from sales highs to courtroom lows.
A deliveries blowout with strings attached
Tesla’s third quarter was a comeback quarter: 497,099 vehicles delivered, up about 7% year-over-year and comfortably ahead of Wall Street forecasts. The company also notched a record in energy storage, deploying 12.5 GWh. That kind of scale is what investors have been waiting for after months of choppy performance and demand concerns.
But context, as usual, matters. Much of the surge was tied to a last-minute consumer rush before the Sept. 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. Tesla leaned hard into the deadline, urging buyers to “act now” before incentives vanished. That boost means the fourth quarter could look leaner — and analysts warn Tesla’s growth engine is running against heavy competition from Chinese EV makers and subsidy cliffs at home.
Cybertruck tragedy under fire
Tesla is also staring down fresh legal scrutiny. The family of 19-year-old Krysta Tsukahara has filed a wrongful death suit, claiming she was trapped inside a Cybertruck after a November 2024 crash in Piedmont, Calif. According to the complaint, electronic door handles failed after impact, preventing passengers from escaping a fire. Tesla, along with the driver’s estate, is named in the suit.
This case lands at a particularly sensitive moment for Tesla’s safety optics. The Cybertruck has already been plagued by recalls and questions about its build quality. Now the case adds a harrowing safety narrative just as Tesla is trying to normalize the vehicle as a mass-market product.
If the court sides with the plaintiffs, it could expose Tesla not only to damages but to broader questions about its design philosophy and risk management. And Tesla could face wider legal fallout and reputational damage — just as it’s leaning into its autonomous arc.
Shareholders push back against Musk's $1 trillion pay plan
In the boardroom, Tesla faces a different kind of test. A coalition of state treasurers, unions, and institutional investors is urging shareholders to reject Musk’s proposed $1 trillion pay package and vote against key board members in November. Their argument is simple: Tesla’s performance targets are vague, its oversight is too thin, and the board is too closely tied to Musk’s interests. The group also opposes reelecting key board members.
Tesla says the pay plan is merit-based — Musk only gets paid if Tesla clears ambitious milestones. But the pushback signals an inflection point. For years, Tesla investors were willing to give Musk near-total leeway in exchange for growth. Now, with governance concerns mounting, they’re starting to demand accountability alongside performance.
Elon Musk’s new net worth milestone
And then there’s Musk himself. For a brief stretch this week, he became the world’s first half-trillionaire, as Tesla’s stock surge pushed his net worth north of $500 billion. That milestone underscored just how closely Musk’s personal wealth is tethered to Tesla’s valuation.
But the moment didn’t last. As shares wobbled, his fortune slipped back below the threshold. The spectacle was fleeting, but it captured the volatility at Tesla’s core: Every triumph in the market is shadowed by risk, every gain vulnerable to a turn in sentiment."

Using dollar-cost averaging — aka, the strategy of investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price — a disciplined Tesla investor would have accumulated some significant wealth over the past five years and nine months.
The Numbers That Matter
From January 2020 through September 2025, buying $1,000 of Tesla stock monthly would have produced impressive results:
-
Total invested: $69,000 over 69 months
-
Shares accumulated: 399.43 shares
-
Portfolio value: $175,912.26
-
Average cost per share: $172.75
-
Total return: $106,912.26 (155% gain)
These calculations use Tesla’s adjusted closing prices, which account for the company’s stock splits in August 2020 (5-for-1) and August 2022 (3-for-1). The final value uses Tesla’s closing price of $440.41 on Sept. 26, 2025.

How Dollar-Cost Averaging Smoothed Tesla’s Wild Ride
Tesla’s stock price has been notoriously volatile, swinging from lows around $50 (split-adjusted) to highs over $400 during this period. Dollar-cost averaging helped smooth out these dramatic price swings by purchasing more shares when prices were low and fewer shares when prices were high.
This strategy proved particularly valuable during Tesla’s rough patches. When the stock plummeted in 2022 and early 2023, monthly buyers were accumulating shares at bargain prices. Those cheaper shares contributed significantly to the overall returns when Tesla’s price recovered.
The average cost of $172.75 per share shows how this approach captured Tesla’s long-term upward trend while avoiding the impossible task of timing the market perfectly.
What This Strategy Missed
While the results are impressive, it’s worth noting what this approach couldn’t capture. A perfect market timer who bought only at Tesla’s lowest points and sold at peaks would have generated much higher returns.
Similarly, someone who invested a $69,000 lump sum at Tesla’s absolute bottom would have outperformed the dollar-cost averaging approach. But predicting these optimal entry and exit points is nearly impossible in practice.
The monthly investment strategy also meant buying shares at Tesla’s peaks, including prices above $400 per share during the stock’s various rallies. These higher-priced purchases dragged down the overall return compared to perfect timing."

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the stocks Wall Street is watching.
Tesla posted strong Q3 delivery numbers on Thursday, but many analysts believe the company will not be able to see robust demand in the coming quarters. Tesla's delivery numbers saw a boost because customers scrambled to buy EVs ahead of the expiration of tax credits.
CFRA’s Garrett Nelson said in a program on Schwab Network on August 15 that he does not see “any” upside for Tesla shares amid concerns about the EV maker’s sales growth and an expected hit to its profitability. Here is what the analyst said:
“Our big concern is looking out over the next 12 months. Tesla, we thought it was refreshing that Elon Musk sort of conceded that the company is going to have a rough few quarters ahead in terms of earnings. While we think Q3 is going to be relatively strong, we’re really more concerned about Q4 and then into the first half of next year. After the federal EV tax credit expires at the end of September, I think Tesla is very susceptible to a pretty significant drop in sales. So really, that’s our big concern with the stock. Of course, there’s so much nuance with this company, lots of puts and takes, but looking out over the next 12 months, which is the basis of our price target, we just don’t see any upside for this stock, considering the headwinds—not only the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, but the regulatory credits, which have been such a big profit driver for Tesla in recent years. Essentially 100% margin on the sale of these regulatory credits—that whole system is going away as well. So that’s going to be a big hit to their profitability.”
Photo by Tesla Fans Schweiz on Unsplash Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

Analyst Edison Lee cut his rating on the stock to underperform from hold, writing that the stock’s current valuation prices in an “overly bullish iPhone outlook.” Shares fell 0.9% on Friday.
The stock’s consensus recommendation — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — now stands at 3.93 out of five, making Apple the least-loved of the Magnificent Seven except for Tesla Inc. Even so, bearish ratings for the stock are relatively rare. Fewer than 7% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a sell-equivalent rating on the shares. Roughly 57% recommend buying, while that ratio is above 90% for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Amazon.com Inc.
The stock has risen more than 20% off a low hit in early August, an advance that has returned it near record levels. Despite that advance, the stock is barely positive this year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index has risen more than 15%.
Much of the recent strength has come on stronger-than-expected demand for the company’s latest iPhone, as well as optimism over an upcoming foldable model.
Lee wrote that “better demand for iPhone 17, partly due to a price cut on the base model, is already in the price,” and this “has led to excessive expectations on 18 Fold, and the replacement cycle.”
He added that it was unclear what market there would be for a phone that costs around $2,000, and trimmed his price target to $205.16 from $205.82. The stock last closed at $257.13, meaning the new target points to downside of more than 20%.

Most Popular Narrative: 2.5% Overvalued
According to BlackGoat, Tesla’s fair value stands just below the latest market close, suggesting the stock trades at a slight premium to the narrative’s calculated worth. With the excitement around Tesla’s technology strategy growing, the narrative lays out the foundation for a bolder future driven by new revenue engines.
Tesla’s business model is shifting from one-time car sales to AI-powered software and service-based recurring revenue models. To estimate Tesla’s intrinsic value over the next 10 years, we model: Automotive Growth: Continued expansion of Model Y sales and new models, with projected annual revenue growth of 15%. Robo-Taxi Monetization: Gradual deployment and scaling of robotaxis, contributing to high-margin, recurring revenue. FSD Licensing: Tesla monetizing self-driving technology by licensing FSD to other automakers. Energy Business Expansion: Increased Megapack and Powerwall adoption, adding further revenue stability. Optimus & Robotics: Potential long-term revenue stream that revolutionizes labor-intensive industries. If Tesla executes on these high-growth, high-margin opportunities, it could reach a multi-trillion-dollar valuation by 2035, making today’s sentiment-driven sell-off an attractive buying opportunity.

Oct 3 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stole the spotlight this week with record third-quarter deliveries, but the milestone rattled Chinese EV rivals. The U.S. automaker handed over 497,099 vehicles in the September quarter, well ahead of Wall Street's consensus hovered around about 440,000 vehicles, according to analyst polls at the time. That number also marks a 7.4% jump compared to last year.
Yet, despite the beat, TSLA stock slipped 5% as investors questioned if the surge stemmed from sustainable demand or a last-minute rush by U.S. buyers to secure the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit.
The strong showing sparked concern for China's EV leaders. BYD slipped after its September NEV shipments fell 5.5% to 396,270 units, the company's first monthly contraction since February 2024. Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) also traded lower in Hong Kong as Tesla prepared to roll out its new six-seater Model Y in China.
Still, not all news was negative for Chinese names. XPeng reported 41,581 deliveries in September (about +95% YoY), while Nio logged 34,749 deliveries (about +64% YoY), according to company releases.

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) is facing a fight over Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package, with a group of shareholders and state officials calling on investors to vote it down at the company's November meeting.
The coalition, which includes SOC Investment Group and the treasurers of Nevada, New Mexico and Connecticut, said the plan puts Musk ahead of shareholders and reflects weak oversight from Tesla's board. They also urged investors to reject the re-election of directors Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.
New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a longtime critic of Tesla's governance, joined the campaign. He argued that the board has been too focused on keeping Musk while falling short on company goals. While New York City's pension funds are not among Tesla's largest investors, they have often influenced shareholder debates at annual meetings.
Tesla last month proposed the pay package, calling it the largest in corporate history. The company said Musk's compensation is tied to performance milestones, meaning he earns nothing if targets are not met.
Tesla is in a tough spot right now with this situation.The company just stated that it had the most deliveries in a quarter ever, but experts predict that demand could plummet when U.S. electric vehicle tax credits run out. Investors are wondering if Musk's way of doing things is in line with long-term value as competition heats up and profitability go down.
The shareholder vote in November will be a big measure of how much faith people have in Musk's leadership and the board's plans."

In a recent presentation, James Altucher predicts that Musk’s financial pressures could spark one of the most significant business moves of the decade
Washington, D.C., Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elon Musk is often described as the wealthiest man alive. But as James Altucher explains in a recent presentation, much of Musk’s fortune is tied up in his companies — and that could force a dramatic decision with wide-reaching consequences.
“As Barron’s reports: ‘When Musk needs money. His only option is to sell Tesla stock. That was the case from April to December 2022, when Musk was forced to sell some $23 billion in Tesla shares to keep Twitter afloat, one of the reasons the stock tumbled more than 50% during that period.”
Altucher notes that this reliance on Tesla stock sales is unsustainable: “What Musk really needs is another publicly traded company that would allow him to unlock some of his wealth and take the pressure off Tesla.”
The Starlink Solution
According to Altucher, Musk already has a clear outlet: a potential spinoff of Starlink, his fast-growing satellite internet venture.
This move would give Musk the ability to diversify his assets while creating a stand-alone company to further accelerate Starlink’s global rollout. Bloomberg reported in 2023: “SpaceX is discussing an initial public offering for its fast-growing Starlink satellite business as soon as late 2024… To get ready, SpaceX has been moving the satellite unit’s assets to a wholly owned subsidiary that would ultimately be spun off in the IPO.”
The Broader Impact
Altucher stresses that Starlink represents more than just another Musk project — it has the potential to reshape one of the world’s largest industries.
“In short, Starlink is the radical new future of the internet.”
By delivering “fast, reliable, unlimited internet through the air… directly to your device, and to the devices of millions of users worldwide.” Starlink challenges the foundations of the telecom sector. “For Consumers Like You and I, Elon’s Starlink Is a Godsend… For the $2.18 Trillion Telecom Industry, It’s Their Worst Nightmare.”
The technology is already being used in global hotspots: “It’s being used on almost every cruise ship and plane in the world… It’s being used in the Ukraine conflict, where all other access to internet service has been cut off… It’s even being used in more than 2.6 million households.”
Why Timing Matters
For Altucher, Musk’s circumstances make this moment especially important. “Because after October 16 passes, you might NEVER have this same chance again.”"

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) just delivered the kind of surprise Wall Street wasn't expecting. Quarterly deliveries hit a record 497,099 units, up 7.4% from last year and well ahead of Bloomberg's consensus of 439,600. The bulk of that growth came from the Model 3 and Model Y, which rose 9.4% year over year, even as sales of higher-end models slumped. The rush was fueled by US consumers pulling forward purchases ahead of the September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credita policy shift that also boosted sales for rivals like GM, Ford, and Hyundai.
Management also spotlighted Tesla's energy business, which quietly delivered its own milestone. Deployments of storage products more than doubled to 12.5 gigawatt hours, compared with 6.9 GWh a year earlier. Alongside that, the company rolled out its next-generation storage system and introduced Megablock, a bundled product that combines storage units with transformer and switchgear technology. Still, Elon Musk has cautioned that the credit-driven boost could lead to weaker demand in the quarters ahead, hinting at rough quarters until autonomous vehicle technology begins to scale.
Despite these risks, Tesla's stock has staged a remarkable recovery. Shares surged 33% in September, recapturing early-year losses and adding nearly $402 billion in market value, before rising another 1% in early October trading. The rally reflects investor confidence in Tesla's longer-term bets on AI, robotics, and driverless systemseven as overseas markets remain a drag. Deliveries from Shanghai have faltered, and in Europe sales fell 22% in August, with registrations down 33% year-to-date even as the broader EV market expanded 27%. Analysts expect Tesla to deliver about 1.61 million vehicles in 2025, down from 1.79 million last year, underscoring the delicate balance between short-term momentum and long-term execution."

However, this record delivery, which smashed past the market consensus of around 447,600 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (as reported by CNBC), was largely driven by the U.S. federal EV subsidy, which expired in September and prompted a rush of buyers hoping to capture the $7,500 tax credit.
This suggests that the impressive third-quarter figures are not exactly indicative of the underlying demand picture for Tesla-made EVs, which still remains uncertain, and thus do not guarantee sustainable organic growth for the company, especially in the absence of the EV incentive. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, warned of potential turbulence for Tesla during its second-quarter 2025 earnings call in July, specifically noting that, with the expiration of U.S. federal EV tax credits in September, the company ""could probably face a few rough quarters.""
Thus, for investors in Tesla-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Simplify Volt TSLA Revolution ETF (TESL), T-REX 2X Long Tesla Daily Target ETF (TSLT), and Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF (TSLW), the next few months may not bode well as the market adjusts to a post-subsidy reality.
Beyond Tesla
In addition to the expiration of the federal EV subsidy expected to cause a potential demand cliff in North America, other key challenges that Tesla has been facing lately include fierce competition (especially from Chinese EV makers like BYD), as well as the ongoing need to manage expectations for its high-risk, high-reward ventures like Full Self-Driving and the Optimus humanoid robot.
Amid this backdrop, investors may find better value and stability in ETFs that focus on legacy automakers such as General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F). There are two primary reasons that might attract investors to this shift in focus.
First, while Tesla is heavily concentrated on EVs, GM and F have established, long-running operations across the entire automobile market. This diversification allows them to leverage profitable segments like internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids to weather volatility in pure EV demand. Second, their decades of operation have endowed them with a more robust and mature international presence, including extensive supply chains and manufacturing footprints, making them less vulnerable to regional market fluctuations than a relatively younger company like Tesla."

Economic data releases and earnings
How does our tendency to procrastinate show up in corporate finance?
For Tesla (TSLA), it's customers rushing to purchase vehicles just before the expiration of crucial tax credits. The electric auto company reported surprisingly strong third quarter global deliveries Thursday as the sunset of the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US appeared to reverse what had been a sales decline.
The sunny report served as a stark reminder that Tesla, and other EV makers, face a harsher market ahead without the draw and cushion of government subsidies. Because it wasn't just Tesla that enjoyed a last-minute feast of sales.
Tesla's robust Q3 followed similarly strong EV sales results from GM (GM), Ford (F), and Rivian (RIVN), my colleague Pras Subramanian reported. Buyers likely fast-tracked their decisions to purchase EVs after a Republican-led Congress phased out the federal tax credit.
The rush to cash in on tax breaks before their end comes at a moment of uncertainty for Tesla. A challenging first half of the year, tied in part to the public backlash against CEO Elon Musk, has weighed on the company, just as it works to redefine itself as an AI and robotics giant.
That helps explain why the stock fell even after beating Wall Street delivery estimates, but remains near all-time highs.
If the criticism against Tesla — the stock — is that it is divorced from the actual business of selling cars, then the response from its leadership and faithful backers is that Tesla isn't a car company, and shouldn't trade like one.
Investors are eyeing production plans for the Cybercab, Tesla's dedicated autonomous vehicle at the heart of its robotaxi service. The company plans to start churning them out as soon as next year. And the bulls hope it's a paradigm shift.
""The AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for TSLA over the next six to nine months has now begun,"" Wedbush analyst and vocal Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note to clients on Thursday.
But what's most striking about Tesla's bull case is that even as the company says farewell to special tax breaks, its most optimistic forecasts rely on — and perhaps even take for granted — another kind of government assistance elevating the company to multitrillion-dollar heights."

Tesla (TSLA) stock tumbled, even after it reported blowout third quarter global deliveries, as the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US likely juiced sales.
Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company.
Tesla (TSLA) stock but fell over 5% in Thursday trading, but looked set to recover slightly when markets open later on, trading up 1.4% in premarket.

Competitor Rivian (RIVN) on Thursday issued a dour forecast that cast a spotlight on the electric vehicle (EV) industry's gloom, as it looks to a world without the federal credit.
Tesla (TSLA) also said global production came in at 447,450. The company deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.
Tesla's huge Q3 follows similarly strong EV sales results from GM (GM), Ford (F), and Rivian. Buyers likely pulled forward EV sales after the Republican-led US government phased out the federal $7,500 (£5,570) EV tax credit.
Occidental (OXY)
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) confirmed on Thursday reports earlier in the week that it is set to buy out Occidental's chemical division, OxyChem, in a $9.7bn, all-cash transaction
The transaction would be the firm's largest deal since it bought Alleghany in 2022 for $11.6bn.
It was earlier reported that Occidental (OXY) was in late-stage talks to sell the OxyChem division in a process aimed at reducing its debt load. The Warren Buffet-owned conglomerate emerged as the suitor on Tuesday, as first reported by the Financial Times.
OxyChem will be an operating subsidiary within Berkshire (BRK-A), the companies said, while a subsidiary of Occidental will retain the chemical unit’s legacy environmental liabilities.
Occidental's stock price lost 7.3% in trade on Thursday but looked set to recover some of those losses, trading 1.3% higher in premarket on Friday.
Asahi (4216.T)
Tokyo-listed shares of beer-maker Asahi (4216.T) remained resilient on Friday, even amid reports that its factories have been shutdown for nearly a week due to a cyber attack.

Will a lost EV tax credit end the rebound?,The EV tax credit has run dry—but Tesla has options to keep sales flowing.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=acae1263cf4cb7f5802985993aff037f765d68f45caa0113911f0f72764ba678,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-vehicle-sales-made-comeback-080000198.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-vehicle-sales-made-comeback-080000198.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-vehicle-sales-made-comeback-080000198.html,yahoo.com,200,,"During a rough week for electric-vehicle makers in the U.S., Tesla investors got at least one piece of good news on Thursday. The EV maker reported a pronounced increase in sales—better numbers than Wall Street had predicted, and a respite from the lagging deliveries Tesla has been reporting over the past two quarters.
While analysts had expected Tesla to sell around 450,000 EVs over the three months ended in September, Tesla ended up delivering more than 497,000—about 100,000 more than the previous quarter, and a 7.5% increase from this time last year. Dan Ives, one of Tesla’s most notorious bulls, blasted out an analyst note that same morning, describing the numbers as a “massive bounce back” for Tesla—a turnaround for a company that has been battered over the first half of this year in several key markets as CEO Elon Musk tried his hand at a brief yet chaotic stint in American politics.
The key question is this: Will it last?
After all, Tesla’s short-term sales surge was closely related to its looming longer-term challenge. One of the key reasons for Tesla’s strong sales figures, investors and analysts noted, was the temporary rush of consumers purchasing an EV right before the elimination of the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. That incentive—which officially ended on Tuesday—had been in place for 17 years and had helped narrow the price gap between electric and gas vehicles for U.S. buyers. Tesla on Wednesday went ahead and increased the cost of leasing its vehicles, as its first move reflecting the change.
With the tax credits no longer available, the change is expected to take a significant toll on consumer demand—at least in the near term.
Tesla is well aware of this. It added risk disclosures in its latest quarterly filings about the potential impact of the loss of the consumer incentive as well as another now-nonexistent sales booster, carbon offset incentives for manufacturers. The EV maker acknowledged the possibility that their removal could harm both demand from Tesla customers and the company’s future financial returns.
Musk himself has opined on the topic, too. “Yeah, we probably could have a few rough quarters,” he said in July on Tesla’s last earnings call, in response to an analyst’s question. “I’m not saying we will, but we could. Q4, Q1, maybe Q2.”
Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist with Zacks Investment Research and an investor in Tesla shares, said in an interview that he’s anticipating a drop-off in sales for the next two quarters or so.
But the long-term impact may be contingent on several other factors: whether Tesla can absorb some of the lost credit in order to keep prices down; whether it can continue to regain market share in markets like Europe and China where its reputation has suffered over the past eight months; and whether the EV maker can deliver on the timelines it has furnished for a more-affordable Model Y."

Months after Elon Musk left the Trump administration — appeasing Tesla investors worried about boycotts — the world's richest man has announced some good news. Sales of Tesla cars are back. Well, maybe.
Musk's EV company reported on Thursday that car sales jumped 7% in the three months through September after plunging for most of the year. Musk's embrace of US President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe turned away large swathes of customers, who came to associate the brand with Musk's controversial ideology.
But the jump comes with a caveat. Tesla benefitted from consumers in the US taking advantage of a $7,500 (€6,400) tax credit before it expired on 30 September, prompting a surge in buying that helped all EV makers.
In fact, many Tesla rivals saw sales rise more. Rivian Automotive, for example, reported a 32% increase.
Tesla stock rose sharply on the sales news, but closed the day down around 5% amid scepticism that the new number really signals a turnaround given all the anti-Musk backlash.
“I don’t think most people are any more enamoured with Elon now than they were a few months ago,"" said Telemetry Insight's Sam Abuelsamid. ""I expect this is more a blip for Tesla than the restart of growth.”
Even Tesla bull Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities was cautious, noting that there are ""still demand issues”.
Still, it was a blowout number with sales hitting 497,099 vehicles, versus 462,890 in the same period last year. Analysts expected a small drop to 456,000.
Investors cheered Musk’s decision in April to leave Washington for Austin, Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. But he is still heavily involved in political and social wars, alienating potential car buyers.
On Wednesday, he posted on X that he was cancelling his Netflix subscription because of what he termed ""transgender woke agenda"", taking offense with the show ""Dead End: Paranormal Park"", which features a transgender character. Musk also responded to a post criticising alleged statements made by the show’s creator, Hamish Steele, related to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Musk's renewed focus on Tesla
The sharp fall in Tesla stock on Thursday was remarkable as investors have been surprisingly optimistic about the company in recent weeks, despite terrible financial figures.
Investors drove the stock up 34% in September alone in a bet that Musk’s planned new cheaper version of his bestselling Model Y will recharge sales.
Musk has also shifted investor attention away from cars to other aspects of the business, such as the rollout of its driverless robotaxi service and its Optimus robots for factory work and household chores.
Driving the stock higher has also been Musk’s apparent renewed focus on the company.
To hold his attention, Tesla's board proposed last month a pay package that would allow Musk to earn $1 trillion (€850 billion) if he meets certain financial goals over the next several years. The pay offer, unprecedented for US companies known for outsized CEO compensation, drew criticism from Pope Leo in an interview lamenting widening income gaps.
If Musk meets the goals, he could set a record on top of his own record. He recently became the first person ever to hit $500bn (€430bn) in net worth, at least according to Forbes magazine's rich list.
Backlash in Europe
The 7% sales rise in the last quarter compares with a 13% drop in the first three months of the year when Musk led Trump’s government cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency. In the following three months through June, sales plunged 13% again.
The anti-Musk backlash in Europe had also been fierce. Sales plunged 40% in more than two dozen countries after he publicly supported far-right politicians there.
Musk said a British prime minister was an “evil tyrant” who belongs in prison and told Germans “things will get very, very much worse” in their country if they didn’t vote for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. Protests broke out in several cities, including a hanging of the billionaire in effigy in Milan and posters in London likening him to a Nazi.
Robyn Denholm, Tesla's head of the board of directors, nonetheless told Bloomberg that she was unsure if Musk’s politics have had any impact on the company’s finances.
Denholm has earned nearly $700 million (€600mn) in compensation for serving on the board since 2014, a package that itself has drawn criticism.
Tesla will report third-quarter earnings later this month. Profits for the previous quarter fell 16% as the company continued to lose market share to European EV makers and fast-growing Chinese rivals, such as BYD.
Musk's new robotaxi service, which began with a test-run in Austin in June, has had some hitches. There have been reports of the cabs stopping suddenly for no reason and even driving in the opposing lane. But Musk says the service will quickly roll out anyway, with launches in several other cities earmarked for the end of next year."

- Sales may have benefited from customers rushing to buy EVs before the expiration of a key tax credit.
- Some caution that momentum could fade now that the tax credit is no longer available.
The move: Tesla stock jumped as much as 2% on Thursday, before reversing gains to trade lower by about 0.5%.
Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker has had a wild year in 2025. It's up 13% year-to-date after being down as much as 45%.
Why: Tesla reported 497,099 vehicle deliveries in the third quarter, a 7% increase over the same period last year. FactSet data shows Wall Street analysts were anticipating 447,600 quarterly deliveries.
What it means: The estimate-beating delivery figures are a needed break for the company, which saw revenue decline by the most in 10 years in the second quarter.
But there's still reason to be cautious.
The latest figures could reflect a rush to buy EVs before the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit, which expired on September 30. The company had a countdown clock on its webpage urging buyers to lock in their purchase before the credit expired.
Sales could wane now that the incentive is no longer available, some analysts have warned. Additionally, Ford CEO Jim Farley recently said that Chinese companies are dominating all major US EV producers, including Tesla.
""Seeing a lot of new Teslas on the road as the rush to cash in on the credits definitely helped the qtr in a big way,"" hedge fund manager and Tesla investor Ross Gerber posted on X. ""Sadly though, this is the end of the rush and winter is coming."""

Musk Says ‘Cancel Netflix'
Tesla CEO and world's richest man Elon Musk took to the social media platform X, which he owns, to encourage Netflix subscribers to cancel their subscriptions.
Musk shared several posts on social media from others that encouraged the cancellations.
""Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,"" Musk tweeted.
Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends
The support to ""cancel Netflix"" by Musk comes after accounts shared a clip from animated Netflix original ""Dead End: Paranormal Park.""
The show has a transgender character and also comes with a Y7 rating, with several accounts saying this means the show is targeted at children and pushing trans ideals on kids.
A report from Variety says the show ran for two seasons and was later cancelled in 2023, but all episodes remain available to stream on the platform.
The series creator Hamish Steele shared several posts on social media saying Netflix is not promoting the show.
This is not the first time Musk has told his more than 200 million followers on X to cancel streaming subscriptions. In 2023, he previously told his followers and supporters to cancel Disney+ and Hulu as he waged war against the media company over advertising on X.
The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) may have lost 1.7 million streaming subscribers recently due to their suspension of late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.
Oracle of Omaha Stands In Netflix's Corner
Netflix could see a rush of cancellations and the term, ""cancel Netflix"", hit its second-highest mark on Google Trends in the past 12 months.
The good news is the company had key content in the third quarter and the current fourth quarter that could help bring in new subscribers — and it received some support from billionaire Warren Buffett.

The move is primarily a result of an accumulation of positive newsflow throughout the month, rather than any one overarching event.
Three reasons Tesla stock soared in September
First, CEO Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of stock in the open market on Sept. 12, which helped boost confidence in the company's future. Musk's leadership of Tesla and the fact that the real value in the company lies in technology that hasn't been fully developed or even approved for widespread commercial operation mean that his words on the company matter.
And his actions matter even more. As such, investors took heart from his substantial stock purchase.
Second, as every Tesla investor and potential Tesla vehicle owner in the U.S. is aware, the federal tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs) (both new and used) expired on Sept. 30, and the market was well aware that there would be a pull-forward of EV purchases before the expiry. However, the question was over the quantum of the pull forward. The question was further complicated by the Model Y refresh that took place earlier in the year and its potential impact on sales.
While Tesla doesn't break out sales from its Model 3 and Model Y sales (its two best-selling models), the delivery data for Model 3/Y for the third quarter came in significantly ahead of the Wall Street consensus, with 481,166 deliveries in the quarter, up by 9.4% from the 439,975 reported in the third quarter of 2024.
Third, Tesla's EVs are only part of the investment case for the stock, but most investors attribute more value to the potential of the robotaxi business. Fortunately, the rollout continues, and in September, transportation authorities in two new states, Arizona and Nevada, gave approval for Tesla to start testing autonomous vehicles on public roads.
Where next for Tesla
The pull forward in EV sales in the third quarter could lead to a significant decline in the fourth quarter. However, Tesla plans to introduce a lower-cost model in the fourth quarter, which could boost delivery growth. At the same time, if Tesla can build momentum with the robotaxi rollout ahead of an approval for a fully autonomous robotaxi service, the stock is likely to find favor with investors."

Elon Musk has become the world’s first $500 billion man. Well, at least briefly, according to Forbes.
Tesla surprised Wall Street with record quarterly sales as consumers rushed to snag an electric vehicle before federal tax credits expired, analysts said. Tesla shares fell on the news as investors worried future sales would dwindle without the incentive, but they gained enough briefly the prior day to push up the Tesla CEO's net worth further into the stratosphere before falling back on Oct. 2.
That was the first time anyone has ever been worth that much, Forbes said.
The EV giant delivered between July and September a record 497,099 vehicles worldwide, up 7.4% from a year ago and above the 439,600 average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan combined sales rose 9.4% to 481,166 vehicles, Tesla said.
Though Tesla shares fell on Oct. 2, shares had gained enough briefly the prior day briefly push up Tesla CEO Elon Musk's worth above $500 billion, according to Forbes. That's the first time anyone has ever been worth that much, Forbes said.
Tesla's strong performance wasn't surprising, with Ford posting record EV sales in the same period and GM seeing sales double, but analysts cautioned that good times may not last now that the $7,500 tax credit has expired. The credit for new EV purchases lapsed on Sept. 30.
""With these credits no longer available, the future is quite uncertain."" said Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at research and shopping site CarGurus. ""EV demand is expected to decline, especially after this recent run-up in sales in response to tax credit availability, but how steeply that could drop is unknown.""
What do EV makers predict?
EV makers expect sales to slow. ""We’re already seeing a number of automakers cancel or scale back their EV product plans,"" Roberts said.
Jim Farley Ford, Ford chief executive officer, recently estimated EV demand could halve with the expiration of the tax credit.
Companies are also adjusting their prices to brace for a slowdown, he said. Hyundai cut prices on its electric Ioniq SUV and Tesla increased lease prices, he noted.
Even Musk has already outlined the company's pivot toward autonomous vehicles and robots. He's also focused on more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and energy deployment.
Why does Tesla stock continue to rise?
Investors have looked past Tesla's murky outlook for its main business selling EVs because they believe Musk can lead the company to the next big thing.
It also helps Tesla's board and Musk exude confidence. The board's proposing investors vote for a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk. The full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares.
Musk is already Tesla's largest shareholder with about a 12% stake in the company. Last month, Musk also bought about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, his first open market purchase of the electric vehicle-maker's shares since February 2020, regulatory filings showed.
As a result of that optimism, Tesla shares have risen around 15% this year.
Is Elon Musk the richest person in the world?
Recent gains in Tesla stock helped Musk regain his title of world's richest person from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and become the first person to ever surpass $500 billion in net worth, Forbes said.
After a short stint as the world's richest person on Sept. 10, when Oracle's stock soared due to strong earnings and AI cloud contracts, Ellison has fallen back to No. 2 with a fortune of about $350.7 billion.
Ellison's net worth had peaked at $393 billion.

Why It's Important: Once imagined as an electric pickup truck that would sell 250,000 units annually, the Cybertruck has failed to live up to sales expectations from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
The unique design and high cost may have kept consumers away from buying Cybertrucks.
While the everyday consumer isn't buying Cybertrucks, the unique design and bulletproof capabilities have police departments and law enforcement eager to add the vehicles to their fleets.

Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.

Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week. President Trump is amping up his rhetoric against Democrats, threatening to fire ""thousands"" of federal workers and canceling billions of dollars in federal funding to blue states.
Trump said he is meeting on Thursday with OMB Director Russ Vought, who has been leading White House strategy in the shutdown, to discuss which ""Democrat Agencies"" should be cut.
In any case, Friday's scheduled release of the September jobs report is all but certain to be delayed. That has Wall Street looking elsewhere during the federal data blackout, as Fed policymakers have indicated cracks in the labor market will loom large in their October rate decision.
Private data from the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found hiring plans at their lowest level since 2009, even as layoffs fell. The report provided more evidence of the softening ""low hire, low fire"" labor market after Wednesday's ADP report. Investors remain near-unanimous on bets for a cut at the Fed's next meeting.
Elsewhere in corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares took a hit despite a record sales quarter as investors turned focus to future performance without the federal EV tax credit.

OpenAI valuation spurs stock rally in Nvidia, AI chipmakers
Excitement over OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) $500 billion valuation sparked a rally in AI stocks on Thursday, after the company surpassed Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup.
Shares of AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and AMD (AMD) gained about 1.5%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, in early trading.
Nvidia stock hit an intraday all-time high of $190 on Thursday morning, as optimism around AI chip demand eased investors' concerns about Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI.
It's been a news-filled week for OpenAI, which released its new video generation AI model, Sora, and announced a partnership with Samsung (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS) to increase the supply of advanced memory chips. Current and former OpenAI employees also sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors, which is what boosted the ChatGPT maker's valuation to an estimated $500 billion.

Bessent on the government shutdown: 'We could see a hit to the GDP'
As the federal government enters day two of a shutdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the gridlock could slow US economic growth.
“This isn’t the way to have a discussion, shutting down the government and lowering the GDP,” Bessent told CNBC's “Squawk Box.” “We could see a hit to the GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America.”
The US's gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% in the third quarter, growing for the second straight quarter after growth contracted in the first quarter.
On Wednesday, US senators failed to advance a plan to fund the government after another round of votes. But as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul notes, the White House also appears poised to use the shutdown as an opportunity to expand Trump's powers to potentially fire government workers or cut programs.
""A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,"" Trump said ahead of the stoppage. ""We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want, and they'd be Democrat things.""

FICO stock soars after the data company begins offering scores directly to lenders
Fair Isaac (FICO), a data analytics company that provides measures of consumer risk, said on Thursday that it would begin selling FICO scores directly to mortgage lenders, circumventing the three major credit bureaus.
FICO stock soared nearly 19% in premarket trading on Thursday, while shares of credit bureaus TransUnion (TRU) and Equifax (EFX) fell 12% each. Experian (EXPN.L) stock, which trades on the London exchange, also dropped 5%.
FICO will sell scores to lenders for a royalty fee of $4.95 per score, undercutting the fees from resellers by 50% on average, the company said. FICO-score mortgage loans that close will also incur a fee of $33.
The move comes as the company faces competition from its lone rival, VantageScore Solutions. In July, government-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dealt a blow to FICO by giving lenders a green light to use VantageScore to buy a home.
Since July 8, excluding today's premarket move, FICO shares have declined by around 20%. If today's upswing holds, the stock will have regained nearly all its losses since then.

Interesting AM analyst calls
It's almost earnings season!
And that means the start of interesting pre-earnings notes from the Street.
A few that caught my attention pre-5am:
Chipotle: Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo leaves an Outperform rating on Chipotle (CMG). But he all but hints the stock could get hit again on third quarter earnings. ""With persisting macro pressures and a weakening labor market, we expect Chipotle’s same-store sales to miss 3Q25 expectations. Rather than by ‘Mexican food fatigue’, ‘excessive pricing’ or ‘rising competition’, we continue to believe that the relative demand weakness is driven by consumer confidence declining, greater exposure to more impacted demographics, and partially by the increased promotional environment that is compressing consumers’ willingness to pay $10+ for their lunch. We are also conscious that rising beef prices may impact restaurant level margins given Chipotle’s commitment not to take price near term,"" says Gargiulo. My recent Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright for my insight into the company at this juncture.
PepsiCo: No rest for the weary at PepsiCo (PEP) as it contends with new activist investor Elliott Management and a largely bearish Wall Street. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi is keeping a Sector-Perform rating PepsiCo, but similar to Gargiulo on Chipotle sound quite bearish on PepsiCo into earnings. ""We are expecting another difficult quarter for PepsiCo headlined by continued sluggish top line results in North America as snacking volumes continue to be a challenge, with muted PBNA [North America beverages] trends and pockets of international softness (Coca-Cola (KO) was talking down international beverage volumes in early September),"" Modi said.
Alibaba: Alibaba (BABA) is seeing interest today on the Yahoo Finance platform amid estimate raises from JP Morgan analyst Alex Yao. The stock is up 36% in the past month, and 117% on the year. Explains Yao: ""Alibaba’s share price has outperformed the sector average, as measured by KWEB, by 364 percentage points in the past three months, due to better-than-expected cloud revenue growth rate in 2Q25 and management’s confident articulation of its investment strategy in food delivery and quick commerce, in our view. After attending Alibaba's Apsara conference last week in Hangzhou, we are incrementally more positive on AliCloud for its future revenue generation opportunity with external clients (i.e. cloud revenue) and synergy with domestic ecommerce. We believe the positive development in both cloud and China domestic ecommerce warrants a higher valuation multiple as the narrative of Alibaba shifts towards ‘a tier-one asset in China Internet’ from ‘a domestic ecommerce market share loser.""

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 3.8% in the afternoon session after the company reported record third-quarter deliveries that beat expectations, but investors grew concerned about future demand.
Tesla delivered a record 497,099 vehicles, which was well above Wall Street's forecast. However, the strong sales were largely attributed to a rush from U.S. consumers to buy an electric vehicle before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of September. This created a belief that demand was pulled forward, potentially leading to a weaker fourth quarter and 2026.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Tesla? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock gained 3.1% on the news that Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the company, citing optimism over its artificial intelligence-driven initiatives, robotaxi rollout, and humanoid robotics business.
The stock's gain marked a comeback after a fall in the previous session that was linked to data showing a sales decline in Europe. Analysts at Wedbush and Deutsche Bank showed renewed confidence. Wedbush increased its price target to a Street-high of $600 from $500, stating that Tesla was advancing its path toward an ""AI Revolution."" Deutsche Bank also lifted its price target to $435 from $345 ahead of the company's third-quarter delivery report. Both firms kept their ""Buy"" ratings. The positive sentiment was further supported by more recent sales data, which showed a strong rebound. For instance, new Model Y registrations in Sweden saw a significant increase compared to the previous month, and the company posted its strongest European registration week of the third quarter.
Tesla is up 16.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $442.67 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,199.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company.
Tesla stock rose more than 1% in premarket trading on Friday following a drop of over 5% in Thursday trading. Competitor Rivian (RIVN) on Thursday issued a dour forecast that cast a spotlight on the EV industry's gloom, as it looks to a world without the federal credit.

Tesla also said global production came in at 447,450. The company deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.
Tesla's huge Q3 follows similarly strong EV sales results from GM (GM), Ford (F), and Rivian. Buyers likely pulled forward EV sales after the Republican-led US government phased out the federal $7,500 EV tax credit.
The big question for the industry is how far sales will fall in a post-tax credit sales environment.
""While the numbers were better than expected, we think it is important to highlight the data is backward-looking,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in a note Thursday morning. ""Looking ahead, we think there are still major questions regarding the earnings impact of legislative changes on the tradeable emissions credit market and EV demand in an unsubsidized U.S. market, particularly in light of TSLA's lack of new vehicle models.""
Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned after Q2 earnings that Tesla was in for a ""few rough quarters"" as the company delayed the launch of its cheaper EVs until the federal EV tax credits expired in the US.
Tesla's strong delivery numbers arrive against the backdrop of persistent issues in Europe, where new competition and Musk's right-wing politics have likely alienated buyers.
Per the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell to just 14,831 units in August, a 22.5% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), rose 26.8% in August, with overall registrations regardless of powertrain up 4.7%.
Nevertheless, Tesla stock has been on a tear lately, with shares up over 30% in September. Yesterday's beat only adds to the gains for a company whose investors are betting on AI and robotics products, like the Cybercab, the company's fledgling robotaxi service."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) chief executive Elon Musk became the first person to reach a net worth of $500 billion, Forbes reported Wednesday, as rising valuations in his companies fueled the milestone. Musk's wealth stood at $500.1 billion as of 4:15 p.m. Eastern, according to the Forbes billionaires index.
Musk's fortune is tied largely to his 12.4% stake in Tesla, which has gained more than 14% so far this year. Shares rose 3.3% Wednesday, adding about $6 billion to his net worth. Investor sentiment has improved since Tesla's board said Musk had returned front and center at the company. Musk also disclosed a $1 billion personal purchase of Tesla stock last month.
Tesla shares remain among the weaker performers in the Magnificent Seven group of large-cap tech stocks this year, pressured by declining car sales and margin challenges. The company's board recently proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for Musk, linking pay to aggressive performance targets while addressing his calls for a larger stake.
Valuations of Musk's other businesses also lifted his wealth. His AI startup xAI was valued at $75 billion in July and has been linked to a potential fundraising at $200 billion. SpaceX, meanwhile, has been in talks to sell insider shares in a deal that could value the company near $400 billion, Bloomberg reported.
Oracle founder Larry Ellison ranks second on Forbes' billionaire list at $350.7 billion."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock surged more than 3% on Wednesday ahead of its third-quarter delivery report, which is scheduled for release on Oct. 2.
Brokerage William Blair lifted its forecast to 480,000 vehicles for the quarter, topping the market consensus of about 448,000. The company delivered 336,681 vehicles in the first quarter and 384,122 in the second quarter of 2025. Last year in the same period, deliveries totaled 462,890.
Analyst Jed Dorsheimer said the expiration of the $7,500 U.S. electric vehicle tax credit drove stronger demand than expected. He cautioned, however, that fourth-quarter results could be pressured by weaker margins and softer revenue from regulatory credits.
The analyst noted momentum from new initiatives such as robotaxi plans, Elon Musk's recent stock purchase, and energy storage products has helped push Tesla shares near record highs. Demand for the Model Y in the U.S. and a rebound in China are offsetting weakness in European markets, he added.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said Tesla, valued at about $1.3 trillion, remains the smallest of the so-called Magnificent Seven but sees its potential as larger given opportunities in areas such as physical artificial intelligence."

Here's what you need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Mixed as Major Indexes Look to Add to Record Highs
Stock futures are mixed this morning after major indexes closed higher for the fourth straight day yesterday, as investors brushed aside concerns about the potential impact of the federal government shutdown. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index, which hit a record high yesterday, were up 0.2% recently, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell slightly after the blue chip index closed at a record high for the second straight day. Futures linked to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.6% this morning. Gold futures were at $3,910 an ounce, trading near an all-time high, while bitcoin rose to $118,700 and was trading at its highest level since mid-August. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects a range of consumer loans, was little changed at 4.10%.
2. Shutdown Continues, Affecting Data Releases and Potentially Leading to Worker Layoffs
The Senate on Wednesday again failed to pass proposals from Democrats and Republicans to keep the government open. With the Senate not scheduled to be in session today, the federal government shutdown is expected to last at least until Friday, the next opportunity for lawmakers to vote on legislation to fund the government. In the meantime, the shutdown will delay today’s release of weekly initial jobless claims and affect the delivery of other economic data, including tomorrow’s highly anticipated release of the September jobs report. As many as 900,000 federal workers could be laid off, at least temporarily, due to the shutdown.
3. Tesla Expected to Report Strong Deliveries As Tax Credits Expire
Tesla (TSLA) is expected to report that its third-quarter deliveries increased from the prior two quarters. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha on average estimate that Tesla delivered 446,790 vehicles in the third quarter. That compares with deliveries of 384,122 in the previous quarter but would still be about 4% below results from a year ago. The third-quarter numbers likely got a boost from the Oct. 1 expiration of the government’s tax credit, which offered a $7,500 discount on electric vehicle purchases. Analysts have boosted their outlook for the company recently, citing CEO Elon Musk’s renewed focus on the company, as well as expected advances in self-driving technology and AI services. Tesla shares were up about 2% in premarket trading. Coming into today's session, the stock was up 14% in 2025, helping make Musk the first person worth $500 billion.
4. Stellantis Shares Surge as Sales Rise
Shares of Stellantis (STLA) jumped 6% in premarket trading after the automaker reported strong U.S. sales growth. Stellantis said sales rose 6% in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, as sales in September surged 16%. “Fueled by sales growth across the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and FIAT brands, our U.S. sales saw strong results in the third quarter, including the month of September, which was our highest monthly market share in the U.S. in 15 months,” said Jeff Kommor, head of U.S. sales, in a release. Stellantis reported a net loss in the first half of the year as tariffs weighed on the company's performance.
5. OpenAI Achieves $500B Valuation to Overtake SpaceX, Report Says
ChatGPT maker OpenAI has completed a deal to help its employees sell shares of the company, putting the overall valuation of OpenAI at $500 billion, according to a Bloomberg report. That would make it the world’s most valuable startup, coming in above Musk’s SpaceX. Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors that included Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, the report said. Earlier this year, OpenAI was valued at nearly $300 billion."

The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has seen his wealth pass a new milestone: he is officially halfway to becoming the first-ever trillionaire.
Shares in Tesla, Musk's EV company, gained nearly 4% as of 15.30 ET, which is 21.30 in Central Europe. That added an estimated $9.3 billion (€7.9bn) to his fortune, according to Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires tracker.
The stock movement pushed Musk's wealth just above $500bn (€425.25bn) for a short period, although the moment was short-lived. Musk ended Wednesday worth an estimated $499.1bn.
The tech billionaire regularly makes headlines because of his staggering fortune. Worth just $24.6bn (€20.9bn) in March 2020, Musk had raked in $400bn (€340.4bn) by December 2024, earning the title 'the world's richest man' several times on the way.
Tesla is one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, with a market capitalisation of approximately $1.44 trillion (€1.23tr).
After Musk's foray into politics, the firm also appears to be regaining investors' trust as the CEO renews his focus on the company. Musk spent months in controversial political roles, supporting US President Donald Trump's campaign and the start of his term in office.
Tesla's shares have nearly doubled since April, when Musk announced that he would step back from political roles, and they rose gradually from $227.50 to above $459 on Wednesday.
To show his commitment to the company, Elon Musk recently bought more than 2.5 million Tesla shares, worth about $1bn (€850 million).
To many investors, this step demonstrated his confidence in the company's future, which could make him the world's first trillionaire.
In a more recent development, the Texas-based EV maker appears to have increased its European sales, where its performance had been lagging since Musk took an active role in US President Donald Trump's campaign.
Tesla's sales rose in several European markets in September, according to Reuters, citing local industry data.
A clearer picture of Tesla's performance will come on Thursday, when the EV maker reports global electric-vehicle deliveries. Investors expect approximately 443,000 deliveries for the last quarter.
Tesla isn’t the only company fuelling Musk's fortune. His rocket maker, SpaceX, is now worth $400bn (€340bn) based on a private tender offer in August, and he owns more than 40%, according to Forbes.
Musk also owns xAI Holdings, which was created by merging his AI company with the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The transaction valued the combined company at $113bn (€96bn) and Musk holds just over half of the ownership."

Standardized Performance and Fund details can be obtained by clicking the ETF Ticker in the table above or by visiting us at www.graniteshares.com.
1 The Distribution Rate shown is based on the NAV per share as of October 2, 2025, adjusted for corporate actions. The Distribution Rate is the annual rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution remained the same going forward. The rate represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV adjusted for corporate actions.
2 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents the net investment income (excluding option income) earned by the ETF over the 30-day period ended August 31, 2025. It is expressed as an annualized percentage rate based on the ETF’s share price at the end of that period. This metric does not reflect the total income generated by the fund, as it excludes option premium income central to the YieldBOOST strategy.
3 Each GraniteShares YieldBOOST ETF seeks to generate income by selling put options on the underlying asset. While this strategy can generate attractive premiums, it generally caps the upside potential of the ETF. If the reference asset appreciates significantly, the ETF will not fully participate in those gains. However, if the reference asset declines in value, the ETF may experience losses that are not offset by the income received. Investors may be exposed to downside risk while forgoing upside participation."

With the fusion of imagination and technology, the province is reshaping the future and capturing the world's attention.
At the 2025 China International Big Data Industry Expo in late August, Thai content creator Nattapong was amazed:""I've never seen such a futuristic event,"" he said after stepping into the exhibition halls. The expo showcased over 1,300 cutting-edge technologies and products, from AI translation glasses to Tesla's first appearance at the expo. With 375 global companies in attendance, the ""Digital Valley of China"" made its influence tangible.
If the expo is a ""laboratory of tomorrow"", then Guian New Area is Guizhou's ""central brain."" At the National Integrated Computing Network National (Guizhou) Hub Center, 595 powered racks work nonstop, processing massive volumes of data for applications ranging from weather forecasts to biomedical research.
As a key part of the ""East Data, West Computing"" project, the hub is building 374P of computing power and 50PB of storage. Supported by Guizhou's cool climate and stable geology, the province has attracted leading enterprises like Huawei, Tencent, and Apple. Today, Guian hosts 26 large-scale data (computing power) centers with computing capacity exceeding 81 EFLOPS, making it one of China's leading regions for domestic intelligent computing power.
This digital energy is powering industries across Guizhou. At Geely Guiyang Manufacturing Plant, Nattapong toured workshops where robots and big data drive highly automated production. With more than 200 KUKA Robots, and one new car rolling off the line almost every minute, the factory embodies ""Made in Guizhou"" at an Industry 4.0 Level.
Over the past decade, Geely has cultivated over 40 automobile parts enterprises in Guiyang, creating tens of thousands of jobs. From engines to batteries, the plant represents both industrial transformation and Guizhou's rise as a hub for intelligent manufacturing.
But digital change is not confined to industry. During the expo, visitors traveled in Robobus manufactured by Guizhou-based PIX Moving. Using radar, lidar, and cameras, the shuttles reached Level 4 Autonomy, navigating safely in complex urban conditions. They can also be customized into mobile cafés, shops, or studios for airports, campuses, or tourist sites.
Marveling at the wide windows and ambient lights, Nattapong was inspired by PIX Moving's vision, he even proposed to become their partner in Thailand."

Consumers rushed to get their hands on electric vehicles before the expiration of the EV tax credit. Automakers Ford and GM getting a boost, seeing records for EV sales in the third quarter. But now, that tax credit is in their rear view mirror and we're looking at the road ahead for the auto industry and dealers.
Cox Automotive Executive Analyst Aaron Keting, joining us now to discuss. Aaron, it's good to see you. So, not surprising, right Aaron?
We we expected and we got strong EV sales from from Ford and GM. But let's look ahead now, Erin. You look at that EV market, you take out your crystal ball, Erin, post subsidies.
What do you think that EV market looks like here in the US?
Well, thanks for having me, Josh. I always enjoy talking with you about the car industry. and to be honest with you, we don't see that things are going to fall off a cliff. Look, we're going to see a speed bump here with demand. We already heard today even in some of the sales release calls from the manufacturers. And from articles that came out yesterday that GM, Ford, Hyundai, they're all still holding on to some really decent incentives to continue to juice the market for the EVs. So until inventory really draws down towards the end of the year, I think that we're still going to see some really good deals on EVs.
Um, just because the EV credit went away, yes, that might hurt it, but we're now going to get to see the EV in the wild, if you will, see what the market really shows. And we've got a lot of EVs hitting them in hitting the streets over those last couple months, which means that attention is now more on them and we might start seeing more and more people getting used to seeing EVs and wanting to buy more. So I'm not I'm a little more bullish than maybe others are on how EVs are going to do in the future.
Let me get your take on this, Aaron, because I saw reports, you know, Ford's Jim Farley was talking about this yesterday, and it sounds like Farley expecting demand for EVs to be cut in half next month following the end of these tax incentives. and I'm just curious what what you made of that statement.
You know, it's funny. I was listening to then Randy Parker this morning on his monthly sales call and uh he said quite the opposite. And so I think it depends on which manufacturer you are, what is your plan for electric vehicles and how um strongly do you sit in that portfolio line? We know that Hende is an example has really invested. They're very EV forward, very electrified forward and they're going to be invested and continuing to make sure that they make sure that that power train gets adopted at a larger scale in the US. and I think there's quite a few other manufacturers that are going to do the same.
Now, some we're going to we've already heard of some cancelllations or slowing in production and that will sort of help us see what demand looks like versus sales and supply, but I don't think that the 5%, you know, cutting it in half over the next month is is terribly realistic.
So we're talking Ford, we're talking at GM Aaron. What about Tesla? Cuz Tesla deliveries, they're on deck as well. I'm curious what your expectations would be there and ahead.
Yeah, I mean, I think Tesla's going to continue to compete, right? They're they are the one brand that's easiest for them to adjust their pricing up or down based on what they're seeing in the market. and the only shop they have in the market is an electric vehicle, right? So they're, I don't know that they're the most natural competitor to look at because by the very virtue of what their portfolio of vehicles are, they have to juice the sales, so to speak on EVs if they want to continue to get their sales numbers in.
Uh but they have been quietly losing share based on the fact that there are a lot of other alternatives in the market and those alternatives are hot sellers right now, even right up until the deadline as of yesterday. and I think we'll continue to see that, um, that trend move on."

What has held GM shares back, you might ask, is the perception that the historic automaker won’t be able to sustain its dominance in an increasingly competitive and innovative market.
However, GM has continued to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving through its subsidiary Cruise, which is lifting sentiment in regard to its long-term growth potential.
In fact, many analysts have become bullish on GM, reflecting growing confidence in the auto giant’s strategy and financial performance.
GM’s Record EV Sales
Adding to the notion that GM may be one of the best automakers to invest in at the moment and can sustain its dominance is that it’s currently the second-leading EV seller in the U.S., behind Tesla TSLA.
Edging Ford F and solidifying its #2 spot, GM reported today that it sold 66,501 EVs in the U.S. during Q3, more than doubling its EV sales from the prior year quarter and marking its highest quarterly EV sales ever.
Year to date, GM’s EV sales have surged 105% from 2024 to over 144,000 units sold. This has been led by its Equinox EV, with over 25,000 units sold, making it the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S.
Furthermore, GM’s luxury Cadillac EVs have also been in high demand, with it noteworthy that the eye-catching surge during Q3 was partly driven by a rush to purchase EVs before the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV owners on September 30. Notably, GM stated total U.S. vehicle sales were up 8% from Q3 2024.
Tracking GM’s Outlook
Following a multi-year peak for annual sales, GM’s top line is expected to contract 4% in fiscal 2025 and is projected to dip another 2% in FY26 to $175.47 billion.
On the bottom line, GM’s EPS is expected to descend from multi-year highs of $10.60 in FY24 to $9.44 per share this year. That said, FY26 EPS is projected to stabilize and rebound 2% to $9.66

GM’s Cheap Valuation
At around $61 a share, GM stock trades at just 6X forward earnings. This offers a distinct discount to its Zacks Automotive-Domestic Industry average of 13X and even Ford’s 10X forward earnings multiple, with Tesla at a very stretched 267X.
In terms of price-to-sales, GM trades at only 0.3X, which is roughly on par with Ford and slightly beneath the industry average of 0.7X, with Tesla at a high premium of 15X.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the stocks that caught analysts' attention.
Garrett Nelson from CFRA recently said in a latest program on Schwab Network that he downgraded Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock to Sell due to Wall Street’s earnings expectations from the company and stock valuation:
“It’s a mix of expectations being too high and then valuation. The stock is now trading well north of 200 times our EPS estimate for next year following this rally of over 100% since the stock bottomed in early April. I think what other analysts are missing are the impact of the one big beautiful bill, specifically some of the measures in there related to EVs. The big one for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) though is the emissions tax credit. They have auto regulatory credit revenue which has been a very high margin fast growing revenue stream. It was about 2.8 billion in revenue for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). But with the signing of that bill in early July basically that revenue went away overnight, most of which dropped right down to the bottom line. So we think the earnings impact of that isn’t fully understood by analysts and for that reason we think the Q3 estimates are too high and then looking out over the next four to six quarters estimates appear too high as well.”
Pixabay/Public Domain Tesla is expected to post strong delivery numbers for Q3 as customers scrambled to buy more EVs amid tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits. However, the company's auto sales could continue to weaken in the long term. Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
All right, I've got time for some of today's trending tickers. Yahoo Finance's Brooke De Palma joins us now for a look at Corteva, Reddit, maybe we'll talk a little Netflix. Brook, who knows? We're going to start with Corteva. That company planning to split its seed and pesticide businesses. Uh so the spin-off of the seed segment will be led by looks sounds like the current CEO expected to be completed second half of next year. The intent here it sounds like give both businesses the company saying the freedom to operate without having to look out for the other. I do see some analysts though skeptical of this one and clearly investors are too.
Yes, investors certainly skeptical. The stock is down about 10% during today's trading session. But keep in mind, year to date, this is a stock that has been performing somewhat well. I mean, it's up about 7% year to date. And so to dive into what exactly this means, Well, the company did have a special call today with its investors. They said that they're targeting capital structures that maintain investment grade credit ratings for both companies. They both are expected to have ample discretionary cash flow to invest in organic growth. The company said, return capital shareholders and consider strategic M&A transactions. So, just to take a step back, once again, these are going to be two separately listed companies. One's going to be called new Corteva. That's their uh current crop protection business. They said that makes up about 44% of current net sales. And the other business will be its seed business and that's going to be called Spinco. Ironically, similar name to what we heard others that have separated their companies from also be called. And that's that currently represents about 56% of net sales. So really just trying to drive growth, they say that both businesses right now are in a good spot and they're really looking to capitalize on that and increase shareholder return.
Yeah, I do see analysts at Barclay's side saying this does not seem to be a clear value creator for the companies. They say we see a potential breakup resulting in the deterioration of both businesses.
Different, different takes there.
There you go. During now to Reddit, what you got that one. New data showing a drop in open AI citations, Brooke, for the platform. So this is Bloomberg Intelligence analyst citing a drop in open AI citations, the decline shows Reddit's exposure, they're saying to search engine traffic and any changes to algorithms from large language model companies.
Yeah, this is a company that has certainly taken off year to date up nearly 24%. And now we're seeing this major pullback down more than 11% today and over the past five days, the stock is down 14%. And largely what we are hearing here is that, you know, Reddit content is cited in less chat, GBT chat GBT the responses, then originally had been intended. They said at the peak back in September, Reddit was cited in more than 14% of answers. And so really it's this this understanding of where exactly Reddit information will be used in that key AI driven model moving forward and also what this means as Google, you know, really teams up with Open AI as there's other partnerships happening around Reddit and how exactly they do plan to step into that. We also know that Reddit launched their own AI search and ad tools, advertising of course, of course, a big business for Reddit given that within the threads, within the communities, you see key players just today I was looking at one and I saw Target being promoted on there. And so it'll be interesting to see the way that Reddit can really keep a hold, keep a footprint within this growing AI situation.
Yeah, stock up as you know around 25% these year. It's up more than 200% over the past 12 months and the street's still broadly bullish on this one.
Very much so, yeah.
All right, lastly, a look at Netflix, that says Elon Musk backs calls to cancel Netflix, Brooke. Uh, so we have Elon Musk echoed these calls for a boycott, a cancellation writing, same. Same. in response to a post on X where a user said they, they canceled their subscription.
Yeah, this certainly has escalated over the past 24 hours. It's currently now trending on X formally known as Twitter. Cancel Netflix has about 215,000 posts right now on the social media platform X. And it, it's escalated over the past few days. We heard some hubbub on the internet about canceling Netflix over a show that features a transgender main character. That then got the attention of Elon Musk, who then went to his platform X to tweet or tweet, I guess you could still say, this is not okay. He then went on to say that cancel Netflix for the health of your kids. And just recently at 1:48 this afternoon, he went on again to say cancel Netflix. And certainly when Elon Musk tweets, he has more than 226 million followers. And so this has really picked up the attention of not only his followers but you know, elsewhere and of investors here, the stock is down more than 2% now as you make your way into the close. And also it's gotten the attention of someone that I've spoken to before, that's Robby Starbuck, who was largely behind the DEI initiatives when it comes to Walmart. Also he he's been critical of other brands as well. And so this is this is picking up momentum right now, but, you know, we'll see if it has legs.
We will. All right, thank you, Brooke, appreciate it."

So how much is one share of Tesla worth? Here’s a look at how many times you could charge a few Tesla models for the price of one share.
Also see how much money every American would get if Elon Musk distributed all of his Tesla shares equally.
Tesla’s 2025 in the Market: A Year of Highs and Lows
A great deal of Tesla’s market volatility can be tied to the somewhat mercurial nature of its CEO, billionaire Elon Musk. Throughout the American presidential campaign season of 2024, Musk stumped for then-nominee Donald Trump.
Following President Trump’s inauguration in 2025, Musk briefly joined Trump’s administration as head of the controversial Department of Governmental Efficiency. He then left the department and had a dramatic flameout and social media war-of-words with the president. During that time, the market reacted, with Tesla sales and stock dropping dramatically.
Now that Musk has stepped away from the American political sphere, Tesla’s stock value has begun to stabilize. As of the close on Sept. 30, 2025, the price of a share of Tesla stock is $444.72.

How Many Times Could You Charge a Tesla for a Single Tesla Share?
Given that Tesla’s stock can be more than a little unpredictable, if you’re a Tesla owner who’d rather invest your cash back into your car rather than the company’s stock, you can always put that $444.72 toward charging your electric vehicle (EV) rather than betting on Musk and his company’s value.
According to EnergySage, here’s how much it costs to fully charge the major Tesla models at home.
-
Model 3: Approximately $10.95
-
Model Y: Approximately $14.39
-
Model S: Approximately $17.83
-
Model X: Approximately $17.99
Utilizing those numbers, here’s how many times you could fully charge each Tesla model with the cost of $444.72 per share.
-
Model 3: 40 full charges
-
Model Y: 30 full charges
-
Model S: 24 full charges
-
Model X: 24 full charges
With the above in mind, you might feel comfortable keeping your $444.72 quite literally and figuratively inside your Tesla rather than on the market. However, if you can handle some volatility, investing in the stock could be another option."

Taiwan is resisting pressure from Washington to relocate a large share of chip production to the US, a move that could reshape global supply chains. Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said Wednesday that the proposal for America to produce half of its semiconductors came from Washington, not Taipei, and emphasized that Taiwan has never agreed to such a commitment. He noted the topic was not part of the latest discussions and stressed that Taipei's priority is on negotiations tied to the Section 232 investigation, which has recently expanded to cover additional products.
The US, meanwhile, continues to frame semiconductor security as a national and economic priority. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview this week that discussions with Taipei included ways to lower risks linked to dependence on overseas manufacturing. For years, Washington has pointed to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) and its vast supplier network as both a strength and a vulnerability, particularly after pandemic-era shortages highlighted how vital chips are for industries spanning autos, AI, and defense technologies.
Despite the disagreement, Taiwan's cabinet described progress in the latest round of talks with Lutnick and US representative Jamieson Greer. More than 70% of Taiwan's exports to the US are chip-related and remain under Section 232 review. Negotiations cannot conclude until both sides resolve reciprocal tariff issues and supply chain terms. In July, Washington imposed a 20% reciprocal tariff on imports from Taiwanhigher than rates faced by Japan and South Koreathough semiconductors were excluded while the review continues. For investors, the exemption keeps focus squarely on the strategic semiconductor trade, with ripple effects for Taiwan Semiconductor and downstream players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that rely on stable chip flows."

- Gas-powered SUVs and crossovers also set records in the quarter, particularly redesigned models.
- GM sold 710,347 vehicles in the quarter across its full lineup, an 8% change year over year.
General Motors set an electric vehicle sales record in the third quarter, more than doubling sales year-over-year, ahead of the federal tax credit expiration.
GM reported Oct. 1 that it sold 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter in the United States, compared with 32,095 last year at this time, further cementing GM's position as the second-largest seller of electric vehicles in the United States behind Tesla.
GM sold 710,347 vehicles in the quarter across its full lineup, an 8% change year over year.
The Detroit automaker also set record sales for gas-powered crossovers and SUVs across its brands, particularly redesigned models such as the Chevrolet Traverse, Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Acadia, GMC Terrain and Buick Enclave.
Buick faced double-digit losses in the quarter while Cadillac had its best quarter in over a decade, GM said.
Duncan Aldred, senior vice president and president of North America for GM, told the Detroit Free Press that the automaker set records in a quarter much stronger than anticipated.
“When the tariffs were announced, we thought there was a pull ahead effect, which would give a payback later on,” he said. “That payback hasn't really come.”
Tax credit boost
Similarly, Aldred said the company is sure of strong electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter despite another potential pull-ahead sales effect from losing the tax credits.
Car buyers were eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 on qualifying new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 on a used EVs. President Donald Trump signed a bill in July pushing up the expiration date for the federal clean vehicle tax credit, which expired Sept. 30 instead of its original expiration date in 2032.
Car shopping experts forewarned that the rush of buyers would all but halt without the credit, though GM and Ford managed to find a work-around that allowed EVs intended for leasing to qualify ― while supplies last.
“We've invested an awful lot into what is an exceptional EV portfolio, the broadest in the industry,” Aldred said. “We love the products, the customers love the products, we think we can maintain a healthy level of sales going forward.”
Other sales results
GM sold 40,780 Buicks in the quarter, down 14%. Total Chevrolet sales of 458,189 rose 8%, and GMC sales increased 9% to 164,853 vehicles.
Cadillac sales leaped 25% in the quarter to 46,525.
GM outsold two of its major competitors in the quarter.
For the third quarter, Toyota Motor North America reported sales of 629,137 vehicles, up 16% on a volume basis compared with the third quarter of 2024.
Ford Motor Co. reported it sold 545,522 vehicles in the quarter, an 8.2% increase year over year. Stellantis has not yet reported third-quarter results.

The change follows the end of tax incentives under sweeping legislation passed by Congress, which eliminated the $7,500 credit for new EV leases and purchases, as well as a $4,000 credit for used EVs, effective September 30.
Tesla and its rivals had been passing these credits on to customers through competitive lease offers.
The monthly lease of the electric vehicle manufacturer's best-selling Model Y increased to a range between $529 and $599, from a range of $479 to $529. Prices of all vehicles, however, remain unchanged.
Model 3 lease prices touched a range of $429 to $759 per month, from a range of $349 to $699.
Demand for battery-powered models is already showing signs of a slowdown after rapid growth earlier in the decade. Sales could drop after the credits dry up, auto executives and analysts have warned.
Reuters reported last month that Tesla's U.S. market share dropped to a near eight-year low in August, as buyers chose electric vehicles from a growing stable of rivals, according to data from research firm Cox Automotive.
Tesla, which once held more than 80% of the EV market in the United States, accounted for only 38% of the country's total EV sales in August, according to early data from Cox.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has delivered one of the sharpest rallies in the S&P 500 (SPY) this month, with shares climbing more than 30% in September and nearly doubling since April after President Donald Trump paused global tariffs. Investors are leaning into the possibility that Elon Musk can reposition the company as more than an automaker, with the board's proposed $1 trillion pay package reflecting confidence in his push toward artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and self-driving taxis. With the stock trading near its December 2021 peak of $479.86, the upcoming third-quarter sales figures could play an outsized role in determining whether the rally has further room to run or risks losing momentum.
Analysts remain divided on the fundamentals underpinning the surge. Irene Tunkel at BCA Research argued that Tesla's earnings have been shrinking while EV demand softens and credits vanish, suggesting the current valuation rests heavily on momentum. Ross Gerber, a long-time Tesla investor, put the core auto business closer to $150 a share, with the remainder reflecting Musk's AI ambitions. At the same time, consumer buying has been pulled forward by the expiration of federal EV tax credits under the Trump administration, which could lead to slower sales in the coming quarters. For now, Tesla's rally appears to be driven less by deliveries and more by enthusiasm around its next chapter.
On Wall Street, optimism about that chapter has gained traction. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his target to $600, citing what he described as Tesla's next stage of its AI autonomous path. Musk has added to the narrative, saying the company could ultimately generate 80% of revenue from AI-driven robots and even suggesting Tesla will feel almost like a sentient being. Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Financial, noted that while skepticism is reasonable, the market is rewarding early leaders in embodied intelligence, and Tesla could benefit if it shows tangible progress. This week's delivery results may influence near-term trading, but the larger question for investors is whether Tesla can evolve from a carmaker into a genuine AI platform."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-10-01T14:40:48,"Ford sales surge 8.2% in Q3, led by trucks and EVs","Ford’s US sales surged in the third quarter, led by its trucks and electrified vehicles.

Ford said it was the seventh consecutive month of sales gains for the automaker.
Ford reported total sales of 545,522, up 8.2% compared to a year ago. Ford sales of pickups like the F-Series, Ranger, and Maverick, combined with its vans, jumped 7.4% to 313,654 units sold, with F-Series trucks up nearly 13% year to date.
Not surprisingly, Ford had its best EV sales ever for the quarter as buyers rushed to purchase electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs and F-150 Lightning pickups ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit this week.
Ford EV sales hit a record 30,612 in the quarter, up 30.2%, led by the Mach-E hitting 20,177 units sold, up a robust 50.7%. Ford said the F-150 Lightning hit a Q3 record 10,005 pickups sold, up nearly 40% and making it the bestselling EV pickup in the US, ahead of Rivian’s (RIVN) R1S and Tesla’s (TSLA) Cybertruck.
Ford stock added nearly 2% in early trade.
“We saw strong performance in gas, hybrid, and electrified powertrains, while at the same time growing our paid software solutions, all embedded in vehicles such as Expedition, Explorer, and F-150,” Ford president Andrew Frick said in a statement.
The continued popularity of Ford hybrids powered the company’s sales. Ford hybrid sales hit a Q3 record at 55,177 units, paced by the Maverick pickup and full-size F-150 hybrid.
Finally, Ford SUV sales surged by 12.2% to just under 199K vehicles sold, as Expedition (up 47%), Bronco (up 41%), and Explorer (up 33%) sales chugged along. Midsize Bronco Sport and Escape sales declined, however, by over 10% each.
The industry expected strong sales for Ford’s Q3, given the fact that its July and August sales were impressive. EV sales stayed strong as the expiring federal tax credit meant buyers need to sign on the dotted line before Tuesday’s deadline.
The company, along with GM (GM), is also reportedly working on preserving the federal EV tax credit for leased vehicles by having its finance arm sign deals for preexisting inventory and passing the savings on to buyers.
Ford’s results came despite headwinds like tariffs and high interest rates; however, Ford’s exposure to offshore production is limited compared to its rival GM, and the company has dipped into 72-month and 84-month financing to blunt higher monthly car payments for its buyers.

In a note ahead of Tesla’s October 2 results, the firm said the expiration of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit has led to a stronger-than-expected pull-forward in demand.
“We now estimate 480,000 deliveries versus the Street’s 443,000,” William Blair wrote, adding that U.S. demand for the new Model Y has been a “bright spot,” while a recovery in China and other markets has offset weakness in Europe.
Despite the upward revision, analysts expressed caution. “Next quarter we are cautious on margins from a hangover on auto deliveries and lower regulatory credit revenue,” they said.
Still, enthusiasm around Tesla’s robotaxi efforts, Elon Musk’s stock purchase, and new energy storage products has “pushed the stock to near all-time highs.”
The firm noted that Tesla shares are now trading at “an enterprise value of 118x our 2026 EBITDA estimate… a significant premium to technology peers at 20-25x.”
Analysts warned that the impacts from the OBBB could require “a reset to Street consensus as the multiple premium will be put under pressure.”
William Blair maintained its Market Perform rating but acknowledged that it is “finding it increasingly difficult to maintain” given the valuation backdrop.
The firm said it would look for “more data points on our bullish views on energy storage and robotaxi to regain momentum” once estimates reset, while citing risks from intensifying Chinese competition, geopolitical exposure to China, and “key-man risk with CEO Elon Musk.”

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) notched its first monthly sales growth of the year in France and Denmark, offering a rare bright spot in a tough 2025 for the electric carmaker in Europe.
Industry data showed September sales rising 2.7% in France and 20.5% in Denmark, where the revamped Model Y finished as the best-selling vehicle. Norway also remained solid, with registrations up 14.7% as Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 held the top two positions.
Sweden told a different story. Registrations fell 64% year over year to 1,726 cars, though the figure marked a sharp rebound from just 210 vehicles in August.
The mixed picture shows how hard it is for Tesla to do business in Europe, where its restricted range of models is facing more and more competition from new electric vehicles made by European and Chinese companies. The last new mass-market vehicle the business made was the vehicle Y in 2020.
Tesla's broader performance this year underscores the pressure. From January through August, sales dropped 42.9% in the European Union and 32.6% across the continent. Rival BYD has even outsold Tesla in the EU twice this year, including in August.
The company hopes its updated Model Y, rolled out in June, can steady demand and lay the groundwork for recovery. Investors will be looking to Tesla's upcoming quarterly results for signs of whether September's gains mark the start of a turnaround or just a temporary lift."

The Tesla CEO, who has 226 million followers on the platform, also amplified several posts claiming a growing trend of Netflix cancellations.
Musk specifically criticized the animated series ""Dead End: Paranormal Park,"" which he claimed was ""pushing trans ideology"" to children. In a separate post, he wrote ""this is not ok"" in response to a user who pointed out that the show is advertised for viewers as young as seven years old.
The streaming giant has faced criticism from conservative voices in recent years over content choices, though the company has generally maintained that it offers programming for diverse audiences.
Musk followed up with another critical X post about Netflix on Wednesday afternoon.
Responding to a post from @Libs of TikTok that ""@netflix appears to openly boasts about discriminating against White people"", Musk tweeted: ""Cancel Netflix.""
The post highlights a Netflix inclusion diversity report, which shows that in 2023, the percentage of Netflix series with an underrepresented lead or co-lead was 71.4%, compared to 58.1% as the industry average.

I never would've gotten my first U.S. job under this structure.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=78b5cd9d406cafdae0833655b83735070d9898b4ee6d9f2f60d7a4af36ed3abc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/h-1b-fee-hike-hold-120000600.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/h-1b-fee-hike-hold-120000600.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/h-1b-fee-hike-hold-120000600.html,yahoo.com,200,,"The recent H-1B visa fee hikes aren’t just policy changes, they’re serious impediments to innovation that will chip away at the foundation that built Silicon Valley’s global leadership.
America has the world’s largest economy and is a world leader in innovation because it attracts and retains the world’s best talent to work on small, high-risk startups that one day blossom into large-cap economic titan. Almost 50% of US companies above $1 billion in valuation have one co-founder who is an immigrant. Uber’s co-founder Garrett Camp is a Canadian immigrant. Elon Musk used the H-1B as a South African immigrant to build Tesla and SpaceX. Eric Yuan was famously rejected eight times for his H-1B to work at Cisco — he then went on to start Zoom, a company that dissolves borders between nations.
There are many such examples — Jayshree Ullal of Arista Networks, Aravind Srinivas of Perplexity, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google — none of these leaders would have stayed in the US if the H-1B program weren’t in place.
The new H-1B fee structure will, in the immediate term, create a two-tiered system that hands hiring power to tech giants and only the well-funded startups who can absorb the $100,000 surcharges for H-1B talent. This would create a chokepoint in supply and demand wherein a lot of the highly talented folks who otherwise could have worked on H-1B would no longer be able to and would head to other countries for opportunities, or return to their home countries.
This is already happening. Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney recently said U.S. visa changes for skilled workers may help Canada retain some of its own talent that leaks to the U.S. but, more interestingly, Canada is preparing “a clear offering” for people in the tech sector who would have otherwise been eligible for an H-1B visa. China has already launched a new “K Visa” to attract global STEM talent. India should surely be thinking about something similar. My guess is that this uncertainty around H-1B sponsorship is going to affect not just average IT workers, but talented Masters or PhD graduates, research scientists, who are in short supply globally.
The message this sends to the world’s brightest students is that the United States does not offer a reliable pathway to success. Only those who see a legitimate H-1B pathway will gamble on an American education, meaning the country will attract fewer of the exceptional minds who have historically powered Silicon Valley’s vibrant startup ecosystem.
I spent 15 years building the technologies of the future in Silicon Valley on an H-1B visa, first at AMD, then at Google. I can say with confidence that I would never have gotten my first U.S. job under today’s fee structure. Under today’s policies, I would have migrated to another country or returned to India."

Popular tech and electric vehicle reviewer Marques Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, may have shocked the EV community by announcing he has cancelled one of two reservations he had for a yet-to-be-released Tesla Roadster from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
What Happened: Brownlee has been a Tesla fan for years. His latest announcement, however, may create some bad blood with fans of the electric vehicle company and CEO Elon Musk.
""I cancelled my Tesla Roadster reservation,"" Brownlee announced on his Waveform Podcast recently.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
The tech reviewer said it's been eight years since his initial reservation. Brownlee then clarified that this is one of two reservations he has for the second-generation Roadster vehicle promised by Tesla.
Brownlee initially paid $50,000 via payments of $5,000 and $45,000 to secure his reservation. Brownlee also said he has a free Tesla Roadster reserved as a referral reward. It’s expected to be a founder's version and one of the first 1,000 released.
""Tesla has been sitting with my 50 grand for eight years and hasn't done anything with it.""
Brownlee said he decided he doesn't need two Roadsters, while also expressing pessimism that his Roadster will ever be delivered.
""Will still get one of the first 1,000 Roadsters, allegedly.""
The YouTuber said he would do something else with the money. The co-hosts of the podcast proceeded to tell Brownlee that if he would have put his $50,000 into Tesla stock instead of the Roadster reservation, it would be worth $747,000.
""Tesla's just had that money the whole time,"" Brownlee responded.
Brownlee said he wouldn't get the first $5,000 placed as a deposit back during the podcast. He later said he did receive the full $50,000 reservation, as reported by Electrek.

Why It's Important: Brownlee cancelling the Tesla Roadster could limit optimism about the vehicle that was expected to enter production in 2020 and continues to have minimal updates from the electric vehicle company.
To make matters worse, Brownlee also shared how difficult it was to cancel his reservation and get his money back.
Unlike other Tesla reservations that have a cancel button in the account settings, Brownlee said there wasn't a button for the Roadster and instead a phone number to call."

""We've learned ... people are not willing to pay [a] $30,000 premium for that big battery on a [$50,000], $60,000 utility,"" Farley told Yahoo Finance at Ford's Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit, Mich. ""But they're willing to buy a $30,000 EV if they save $2,000 a year compared to gas costs.""
Farley's comments underscore the challenges Ford faces as it pushes further into EVs. While global EV demand grows, price sensitivity is shaping which models will succeed.
The CEO said the automaker has been ""No. 2 to Tesla for three years"" and is taking lessons from that experience to better align with consumer demand.
Ford is also rethinking its EV strategy and benchmarking against BYD, China's EV leader. In 2024, BYD reported annual revenue of $107 billion, surpassing Tesla's $97.7 billion.
""[BYD has] full support from the Chinese government ... they've been at this for 20 years,"" he said, adding the company has ""a lot of good"" intellectual property.
""Ford has to innovate, to catch up with BYD because we're a global company,"" Farley said. ""We're going to compete with them around the world.""
He emphasized that electrification is accelerating abroad, and the US is just one part of a worldwide market. Part of those innovation efforts comes in the form of a new ""universal electric vehicle platform"" aimed at affordability. Farley said the goal is a $30,000 EV that appeals to mainstream buyers while maintaining competitive performance and features.
""... We had to reload our capital on what we learned, move as fast as we can, and then we've got to make sure we're future-proof to BYD,"" he added.
He compared the industry’s adoption of electrification to the way technology has transformed other sectors. “Anytime there’s new technology … things changed,” he said, pointing to how Apple’s iPhone reshaped mobile devices and disrupted legacy companies like Motorola.
Analysts note that Ford's approach aligns with broader market realities. In a note to clients, JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman highlighted that while EV demand is growing, minimizing ""EV-related losses going forward"" remains a critical factor for adoption.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote that ""the degree of success with company specific initiatives such as the transition to hybrids/EVs"" is a key factor of the firm's Neutral rating on the stock."

Is It Too Late to Buy?,This semiconductor ETF has been an overlooked champ.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f15f790c8378ed52c410bd25890d55f1e53d0eae62d5a1f6b49e46c71da4fa3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,fool.com,200,,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" has been driving the AI boom ever since its earliest days.
The group of seven stocks, which includes seven of the most valuable stocks on the market -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- all have some exposure to AI and are seen as the leading technological companies.
However, after driving the stock market rally through 2023 and 2024, the Magnificent Seven's performance has been more pedestrian this year. In fact, three of the seven have underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
A basket of all seven of those stocks would have gained 17.5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 through Sept. 26, which was up 13%. That's a solid return, and investors can get exposure to the Magnificent Seven through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.
However, there's one ETF that has not only nearly doubled the return of the Magnificent Seven this year, it's beaten every stock in the elite group through Sept. 26. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH 2.50%), which is up 33.2% year to date, and has a long track record of outperforming the S&P 500.
Meet the VanEck Semiconductor ETF
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF aims to replicate the MVIS U.S.-listed Semiconductor 25 Index, and like the Magnificent Seven, its biggest holdings have significant exposure to AI. These are the top 10 stocks in the ETF.
| Stock | % of ETF |
|---|---|
| Nvidia | 21.8% |
| Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) | 10.6% |
| Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) | 9.5% |
| Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) | 6% |
| Lam Research | 4.4% |
| Analog Devices | 4.4% |
| ASML | 4.2% |
| Micron Technology | 4.1% |
| Texas Instruments | 4.1% |
| Qualcomm | 4.1% |
Nearly 40% of the value of the ETF comes from Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom, three stocks that have been top performers in the AI boom. Notably, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has also outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF because the SMH's holdings are more concentrated in those three leading stocks.
While the Magnificent Seven might hold better-known stocks like Apple and Tesla, semiconductor companies have seen their business soar during the AI boom as they are providing the core computing power to make AI applications work. They form the building blocks of the AI revolution, and should as long as the data center buildout phase continues, with companies like Oracle pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure.
Is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF still a buy?
The VanEck SMH ETF is not only outperforming the S&P 500 this year, but it has a long track record of delivering superior returns. Since its inception in 2011, the fund has gained more than 2,000%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $200,000 and trouncing the S&P 500 along the way, which is up by less than 600% during that time.
Looking at its valuation, the SMH ETF isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as you might think. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39, which is much cheaper than popular AI stocks like Tesla or Palantir Technologies, and is only moderately more expensive than the S&P 500 at a P/E of 28. Meanwhile, some of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top holdings, like Taiwan Semiconductor, still look cheap considering its growth rate.
Given its exposure to the top chip and AI stocks and its diversification across the industry, the SMH ETF still looks like a strong buy. Over the long term, the fund looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500, and given the massive capex spending in AI, it has an edge over the Magnificent Seven group as well."

LONDON (Reuters) -Tesla's sales rose in several European markets in September, including France and Denmark, driven by its updated Model Y, but analysts say the automaker risks losing ground as competition intensifies and its ageing lineup remains unchanged.
The U.S. electric vehicle maker showed continued growth in Norway and Spain, local industry data showed on Wednesday, with the revised Model Y the best-selling model in Denmark.
However, new car registrations - a proxy for sales - fell in Sweden and in the Netherlands for the ninth straight month.
Tesla has seen sales slump in Europe this year, as its limited and ageing lineup contends with a wave of new EVs from European and Chinese manufacturers. The company has not launched a new mass-market model since the Model Y in 2020.
RISING COMPETITION AND BACKLASH VS MUSK
Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research, said the uptick ""reflects a bottoming out of the downward trend rather than any real signs of an expected uplift being anywhere around the corner.""
He added that an affordable version of the Model Y could help in 2026, but ""we expect things will remain tough for Tesla in a more competitive market environment.""
Tesla's competitive problems have been compounded by a backlash by some consumers against its CEO Elon Musk, who helped bankroll Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory last year and has championed European far-right parties.
Tesla has argued that its revamped Model Y, which it began delivering in many European markets in June, would lead a recovery in European sales.
For January-August, Tesla's sales were down 42.9% year-on-year in the European Union and down 32.6% in Europe as a whole.
During the same period, industry-wide EV sales in the EU rose 24.8%.
China's BYD outsold Tesla in the EU in August for the second time this year, though Tesla outperformed its Chinese rival across Europe as a whole.
Only a few years ago Tesla was largely unchallenged in Europe and the Model Y was Europe's top-selling car in 2023, but now faces dozens of much newer models from competitors across the continent.
""Tesla may still be a big fish, but the pond is now full of serious competitors,"" said Andy Palmer, chairman of EV advocacy group Electric Vehicles UK. ""Unless it refreshes its range, it will keep losing market share.""
MIXED RESULTS ACROSS KEY MARKETS
In September, Tesla reported a 2.74% annual increase in sales in France and a 20.5% rise in Denmark.
In Norway, Tesla's registrations were up 14.7%, with its Model Y and Model 3 taking the top two spots for sales. Tesla sales rose 3.4% in Spain, boosted by a 60% increase in new Model Y registrations."

He recently told CNBC, ""This continues to be, in my opinion, the most undervalued true AI play."" That may surprise readers because Ives also covers Nvidia and Palantir, both of which are cornerstones of the AI trade.
Ives says Tesla will eventually achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion as physical artificial intelligence products become a material source of revenue. That forecast implies 115% upside from its current market value just shy of $1.4 trillion. But most analysts are less optimistic. Tesla's median target price of $349 per share implies 21% downside from its current share price of $443.
Is the stock worth buying?
Tesla lost its leadership position in the electric vehicle market to BYD
Tesla has lost substantial market share across China, Europe, and the United States. The company accounted for 12% of battery electric car sales through June, down from 18% in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Chinese automaker BYD gained 2 points of market share to become the global leader as measured by vehicle volume.
Tesla reported dismal financial results in the second quarter. Deliveries declined 13%, due in part to increased competition, but consumers also shied away from the brand due to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. In turn, revenue declined 12% to $22 billion and non-GAAP net income declined 23% to $0.40 per diluted share.
Evidence suggests the third quarter will be equally disappointing. Sales in Europe declined 40% in July and 37% in August. Sales in China dropped 12% in July and 10% in August. And while sales in the U.S. increased modestly in those months, Tesla's U.S. market share still fell to 38%, the first reading below 40% since October 2017, according to Reuters.
Tesla has big opportunities in physical artificial intelligence (self-driving cars and robots)
Tesla currently earns the vast majority of its revenue from electric cars, but has much larger opportunities in autonomous ride-sharing and robotics. Indeed, Elon Musk thinks Tesla can be the most valuable company in the world several times over -- its market value reaching $30 trillion -- if it executes on opportunities in physical artificial intelligence (AI).
In June, Tesla launched its first autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and the company has since received approval to begin testing in Arizona and Nevada. Alphabet's Waymo is still the market leader, with robotaxi services open to the public in five U.S. cities, but Musk says Tesla has an edge that will allow the company to capture 90%+ market share in the future.
Specifically, Waymo uses a broad sensor suite (lidar, radar, and cameras) to create detailed maps that help its robotaxis navigate. But Tesla relies only on computer vision and does not map cities beforehand, an approach that is both cheaper and more scalable. For instance, despite entering the market three months after Waymo, Tesla robotaxis already have twice the coverage area in Austin.
Meanwhile, Tesla is developing an autonomous humanoid robot called Optimus that Musk says will eventually account for 80% of the company's value. The company plans to scale production next year and hopes to build at least a million units annually within five years. Humanoid robots could radically disrupt the labor market by displacing human workers, especially in tedious or dangerous tasks.
How big are those opportunities? Goldman Sachs expects U.S. ride-sharing revenue to hit $100 billion by 2030, but Morgan Stanley estimates the addressable market is closer to $1 trillion. Similarly, Citigroup analysts expect humanoid robot sales to reach $210 billion by 2035, and Morgan Stanley says that figure will hit $5 trillion by 2050.
Tesla stock is worth owning (for some investors) despite an absurd valuation
Tesla is the third most expensive stock in the S&P 500 at 178 times projected earnings for 2026. That multiple is absurd, but it's also irrelevant to some extent. I say that because the company is shifting focus from electric cars to physical AI, which leaves room for earnings growth to accelerate substantially in the future.
Investors that lack conviction in Tesla's ability to pivot to autonomous ride-sharing and humanoid robots should avoid the stock. But risk tolerant investors (those who can handle a 50% decline) that believe Tesla can disrupt the mobility and labor markets should own the stock. Now is as good a time as any to buy a small position."

The change follows the end of tax incentives under sweeping legislation passed by Congress, which eliminated the $7,500 credit for new EV leases and purchases, as well as a $4,000 credit for used EVs, effective September 30.
Tesla, along with its rivals, was receiving the tax credit from the U.S. government and including them in offering attractive lease prices for customers.
The monthly lease of the firm's best-selling Model Y increased to about $599 at the top range from $529. Prices of all vehicles, however, remain unchanged.
Demand for battery-powered models is already showing signs of a slowdown after rapid growth earlier in the decade. Sales could drop after the credits dry up, auto executives and analysts have warned.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the Top AI Stocks in the Spotlight on Wall Street. On September 26, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu raised the price target on the stock to $435.00 (from $345.00) while maintaining a Buy rating.
The firm believes that Tesla is poised to grow as it pushes further in its AI projects, particularly its robotaxi fleet and humanoid robot business.
“Ahead of 3Q25 deliveries next week, we raise our near-term estimates given stronger volume in the quarter but keep our full-year and 2026 outlook mostly unchanged. We think Elon Musk’s clear focus on Tesla’s most important efforts (robotaxi and Optimus) and the recent compensation package have removed a large overhang on the stock and going forward, will allow Tesla to benefit from being a leader in embodied AI. We raise our price target to $435 (up from $345), still based on a multi-modal SOTP framework, incorporating higher multiples in robotaxi and humanoid.”
The firm anticipates Tesla’s electric vehicle business to also be on track to notch deliveries that exceed expectations for the third quarter. This is driven by the launch of its Model Y L in China and surge in US demand ahead of the Trump administration’s planned phase out of incentives for EV buyers.

“We expect Tesla’s 3Q25 deliveries to track meaningfully ahead of consensus expectations (433k), supported by the launch of Model Y L in China and US pre-buy effect ahead of EV incentives going away. We forecast 461.5k deliveries or roughly flat YoY but up +20% QoQ. We expect +20% growth in both China and N. America, with some decline in Europe as competition and branding continues to weigh in on demand. In China QTD through the third week of September, registration data is tracking around 141k units (vs. our 159k estimate for the quarter). Looking at the full-year, consensus is calling for 1.6m in deliveries which still appears achievable. While US sales will likely dip materially in 4Q after the incentives are eliminated, this could be partially offset by a strong quarter in China. We think 4Q volume could be somewhere between 2Q and 3Q, and model 409k units, leading to just below 1.6m units for the full year. Margin-wise, we expect 4Q to decline by 100bps QoQ due to lower volume and potentially higher tariff costs. All in, this translates to $1.53 in EPS vs. current consensus at $1.74.”

As Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently urged the Trump administration against repealing the 2009 Endangerment Finding, the EV giant's rivals are nearing record highs in pre-market.
What Happened: Tesla's two Detroit-based rivals’ stock is performing well as both Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) reached 52-week highs in pre-market trading on Monday as investors see the Trump administration's pro-ICE decisions as a favorable factor for the companies.

F is currently trading at $12.14 in the early hours of Monday, while GM is currently valued at $61.44 per share, according to Benzinga Pro data.
Why It Matters: The news comes as the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had proposed rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which serves as a crucial legal foundation for much of the U.S.'s emissions standards and climate action.
This proposal is in line with The White House's series of anti-EV decisions, like ending the $7,500 Federal EV credit as well as relaxing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms, which dictate the amount of distance a vehicle should cover on a gallon of fuel.
Meanwhile, the decision to relax emissions standards has also affected automakers like Tesla and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), which have lost billions of dollars in revenue that the companies earned via selling ZEV credits.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry."

""I mean, it's frustrating 'cause we're the most American auto company, and we export the most, and yet, we have this $2 billion headwind, which prevents me from investing even more in the US,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told Yahoo Finance at Ford's Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit.
Farley said imported parts — such as wiring looms, fasteners, sensors, and brake components — are sourced from countries like China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. Tariffs on these parts are driving up costs, including for Ford's F-150 truck.
If the company wants to manufacture in the US, it has to ""import literally thousands of dollars of parts on [the] F-150,"" Farley said. Tariffs vary by product and the country of origin, but Ford is paying anywhere between 25% and 70% tariffs on the imported items, which ""adds up to $2 billion.""
The automaker has had ""some really good conversations with the Trump administration,"" Farley said, and is soliciting support from the White House.
""Hey, help us, help us make more in the US by making these tariffs on the parts for cars more reasonable,"" Farley said.

Farley also cited progress on regulatory fronts, noting conversations with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to adjust tailpipe emission rules that better reflect customer demand.
""That gives me hope that we're gonna find a solution for that $2 billion parts bill,"" he said.
Ford's tariff headwind comes against the backdrop of a strong second quarter performance.
During the period, the company generated revenue of $50.2 billion, beating consensus estimates of $44.14 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.37, surpassing the $0.31 expected.
The automaker also updated its full-year EBIT [earnings before interest, taxes] guidance to $6.5 billion-$7.5 billion, which includes the $2 billion net tariff impact. The company had suspended its guidance during the previous quarter due to policy uncertainty.
Wall Street is cautiously optimistic. Analysts note that the underlying business remains strong despite tariff pressures. If Ford can leverage its US manufacturing footprint and capitalize on favorable policy and regulatory shifts, further gains are possible.
In a note to clients, JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote that ""overall execution appears solid,"" pointing to Ford Pro's margin strength and the company's cost-saving initiatives."

The electric-vehicle maker’s shares notched their best month in almost a year, putting them among the 10 best performers in the S&P 500 Index this month. Even more striking is Tesla’s vertical ascent in the market since hitting a low in early April after President Donald Trump paused his sweeping global tariffs. Since April 8, the stock is up 100%, making it the best performer in the high-flying big tech cohort known as the Magnificent Seven.
The bet on Tesla is that Musk can transform it from a car manufacturer into an artificial intelligence powerhouse that makes robots and self-driving taxis. That goal is reflected in the unprecedented $1 trillion pay package the company’s board proposed for the CEO earlier this month.
But with the stock trading around $445, not far from the all-time high of $479.86 it hit on Dec. 17, the question is what will its sales for this quarter look like — and is the company at a peak in deliveries, at least in the short term.
“Tesla trades at an eye-watering multiple, its earnings are shrinking amid softening EV demand and cutthroat competition, and EV credits are about to expire, further dampening sales,” said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research.
The issues surrounding Tesla’s revenue and outlook are real. Tuesday is the last day car buyers can access tax credits for electric-vehicle purchases because the Trump administration eliminated the incentives. Analysts expect third-quarter EV sales to show a jump across the board after consumers rushed to take advantage of the disappearing discount. From here, however, EV sales are likely to slow considerably, they say.
Leaders within the industry have expressed their own concerns. Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tuesday that US EV sales are likely to be cut in half, dropping from roughly 10% of the market to 5% as a result of Trump’s pro-gas policies.
“Tesla’s core business is worth $150 a share” said Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management and a long-time Tesla investor. “Anything investors pay over that for robotaxis and robots is ‘Elon hyperbole.’”"

Wording in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that killed the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set a hard Sept. 30 deadline for claiming the tax credit, but the IRS is giving buyers and automakers a break by allowing a “written binding contract” for the purchase of the vehicle to qualify for the credit in lieu of delivery of that vehicle by Sept. 30.
Over the weekend, automakers like GM (GM), Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA), and Rivian (RIVN) tried to entice Americans to go electric. Tesla even updated its website to say “order by September 30” and included a countdown clock on the site.
However, despite the ongoing coverage of the tax credit's expiration by traditional media and social sites, it appears that a significant percentage of Americans don’t understand how the credits work.
“While most shoppers have heard of the credit, a recent study from Cars.com shows only about a third really understand how it works,” Cars.com Detroit bureau chief Aaron Bragman said to Yahoo Finance.
“That’s important, because nearly 80% of car shoppers considering EVs say it factors into their decision to go electric, and almost half say they might speed up their plans before the deadline hits,” he added.

Here’s how the rules work.
To be eligible, the EVs need to be assembled in North America and must also prove battery materials and components do not originate from countries deemed foreign entities of concern (FEOC), which includes China, Russia, and North Korea. A full list of eligible vehicles is available on the fueleconomy.gov website.
Once that’s out of the way, there are price restrictions. For vehicles like coupes and sedans, the MSRP limit to get the tax credit is $55,000. For trucks and SUVs, the limit is $80,000.
Then, buyer income must be limited to $300,000 in adjusted gross income for joint filers or $150,000 for individual filers to qualify.
Finally, there is the lease exemption. Under the law, leasing EVs falls under the commercial EV credit of the law (known as the 45W credit for commercial clean vehicles), which doesn’t require North American assembly or income requirements.
Basically, the rule says any taxpayer (and automaker) leasing a clean vehicle to customers is eligible to claim the commercial EV credit, meaning every foreign automaker from Kia (000270.KS) to Mercedes (MBGAF) qualifies, as well as very expensive EVs from any automaker."

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.
The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.
2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.
The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Tesla (TSLA) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.69 a share 22 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 22, 2025.
TSLA has an Earnings ESP figure of +45.01%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.69 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.48.
TSLA is just one of a large group of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with a positive ESP figure. Lucid Group (LCID) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.
Lucid Group, which is readying to report earnings on November 6, 2025, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. Its Most Accurate Estimate is currently -$2.25 a share, and LCID is 37 days out from its next earnings report.
Lucid Group's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +3.57% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$2.33.
TSLA and LCID's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.

Dot is designed to look friendly and even cartoonish — painted bright red, with big LED eyes and a mouth that swings open to reveal where it holds your food — though I’d argue it’s slightly creepy.
DoorDash says it’s already testing the robot with early access partners in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and plans to make it available to the region’s 1.6 million residents by the end of 2025.
It might sound odd for a food-delivery app like DoorDash to compete with trillion-dollar companies like Google and Tesla on autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. In San Francisco, Austin, and cities around the country, hailing a robotaxi is already commonplace for many residents. DoorDash argues that a similar reckoning is coming for the food delivery space, and that Dot’s size and design are key.
The stakes are high for this little, cute (terrifying?) robot. Countless startups have flamed out in the AV space, with some even facing penalties and fines when their machines caused harm. Robotaxis have also become a symbol for Silicon Valley’s broader automation push — and a target for public anger. Waymos have been vandalized on city streets, and it’s easy to imagine Dots becoming the next symbol of that tension.
On Monday at the company’s San Francisco headquarters, DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang told reporters that autonomous delivery in suburbs and cities could become a large market. Tang said a key to delivery robots is navigating “the first and last ten feet,” referring to picking up and dropping off deliveries. Sidewalk robots, such as those developed by companies like Serve Robotics, address this challenge of negotiating tight spaces, but they can’t drive on roads or at high speeds like Dot can.
“You don’t always need a full-sized car to deliver a tube of toothpaste or pack of diapers,” said Tang. “Dot is purpose-built for the millions of deliveries we facilitate every day. It is small enough to navigate doorways and driveways, fast enough to maintain food quality, and smart enough to optimize the best routes for delivery.”
Dot has four wheels and stands less than five feet tall and three feet wide. It’s roughly a tenth the size of a car and weighs 350 pounds. Press a button on what can only be described as Dot’s “mouth,” and enough cargo space is revealed to fit six pizza boxes or up to 30 pounds of food. There are various inserts that merchants can put inside of a Dot to meet their needs, including cupholders and coolers."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) received a price target upgrade from Canaccord Genuity, which raised its projection to $490 from $333 and reiterated a Buy rating. The new target represents about 10% upside from the company's last closing price of $443.21.
The analysts said their research across roughly 30 countries pointed to stronger-than-expected deliveries, reversing several quarters of slowing momentum. They noted that management's commitment to new vehicle launches should help sustain global sales growth despite the phaseout of U.S. tax credits after the third quarter.
In addition to vehicles, Canaccord highlighted Tesla's expanding energy storage business. Demand from utilities and hyperscale data centers is expected to drive growth, with energy storage positioned as a critical solution for grid stability and on-site power needs.
Elon Musk's use of on-site energy for his AI company, xAI, was cited as an example of broader adoption, though analysts cautioned about environmental risks tied to such projects. They also flagged Musk's new compensation package, which sets ambitious long-term goals and ties investor returns to Tesla's future performance, while offering indirect exposure to his AI ventures.
Earlier this month, Tesla secured regulatory approval to begin road testing its autonomous ride-hailing program in Arizona. The pilot includes robotaxis in the Phoenix metro area with safety drivers on board.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP
Speaking at the recent “All In Summit,” Musk described his stint in Washington as “a hell of a side quest” and didn’t hold back when asked what he’d learned [1].
“The government is basically unfixable,” he declared, drawing laughter — and then applause — from the audience.
According to DOGE’s website, the initiative has racked up an estimated $206 billion in savings, though critics have questioned the math [2].
For Musk, the real problem is America’s ballooning debt.
“It’s good to have talented people in the administration. But at the end of the day, if you look at our national debt, which is insanely high, the interest payments exceed the Defense Department — I guess, sorry, War Department budget — and they keep rising,” he said.
The numbers back him up. Treasury data show the U.S. paid $933 billion in net interest in fiscal-year-to-date 2025 — more than the $841 billion spent on defense.
That reality underpins Musk’s stark warning: “So if AI and robots don’t solve our national debt, we’re toast.”
‘Debt death spiral’
Musk isn’t the only billionaire sounding alarms. Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has long cautioned that America is heading toward a “debt death spiral,” where the government must borrow simply to pay interest — a vicious cycle that accelerates over time.
With the U.S. national debt at $37.45 trillion, that scenario is no longer far-fetched.
Dalio doesn’t expect an outright default, but he sees another danger: currency erosion.
“There won't be a default — the central bank will come in and we'll print the money and buy it,” he said. “And that's where there's the depreciation of money.”
The dollar’s shrinking buying power is familiar to Americans. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis [3], $100 in 2025 buys what just $12.05 could in 1970.

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-30T07:06:00,"Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid Will Have Their Fortunes Changed Forever Today, Sept. 30, Courtesy of President Donald Trump","President Trump's ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" is reshaping the electric-vehicle (EV) landscape.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=79364e87e08b58ddaf49ddbbb5b9c131fd6b632e50615f8ddffd240b0b37fa87,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/tesla-rivian-lucid-fortunes-change-sept-30-trump/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/tesla-rivian-lucid-fortunes-change-sept-30-trump/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/tesla-rivian-lucid-fortunes-change-sept-30-trump/,fool.com,200,,"When a new president enters office, it's not uncommon for changes to take place, either through the signing of bills into law or via executive orders. Since President Donald Trump was inaugurated a little over eight months ago, we've witnessed a slew of adjustments made to Social Security, as well as the passage of his flagship tax and spending law, the ""Big, Beautiful Bill.""
While Trump's big, beautiful bill introduced a number of tax breaks for select groups, including a higher standard tax deduction for eligible seniors from 2025 through 2028, and partial deductions for tips and overtime pay for eligible workers during the same four-year timeline, it also removed some important benefits.
Specifically, Donald Trump's law changes the fortunes of the electric-vehicle (EV) industry and its leading pure-play manufacturers, which includes Tesla (TSLA 1.39%), Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.17%), and Lucid Group (LCID -1.23%), as of today, Sept. 30.
EV makers bid adieu to an important dangling carrot
Among the laundry list of tax and credit adjustments in the president's big, beautiful bill is a newly shortened timeline that ends the $7,500 tax credit consumers received when purchasing a qualifying new EV or plug-in hybrid, as well as the $4,000 credit when buying a used EV. This EV credit was available to new vans, SUVs, and trucks priced below a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $80,000, as well as new sedans with an MSRP of no more than $55,000.
Though this credit (officially known as the Clean Vehicle Credit) was initially slated to end in 2032, based on the Inflation Reduction Act, Donald Trump's big, beautiful bill brings this new EV purchase credit to an end today, Sept. 30. Qualifying new vehicles purchased after today will no longer be eligible for the $7,500 credit.
This EV credit applied to a significant percentage of the vehicles Tesla sells, including its Model 3 Sedan, all-wheel drive Model X SUV, single and dual motor Cybertruck, and multiple variants of the Model Y SUV. While Rivian's and Lucid's EVs are generally priced above the MSRP range where tax credits end, both companies had been angling leases of upcoming models as a way to take advantage of the $7,500 EV credit.
This EV credit was akin to a dangling carrot that allowed pure-play electric-vehicle manufacturers to be more price-competitive with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Undercutting traditional ICE vehicles on price is viewed as a borderline necessity with EV charging infrastructure still somewhat lacking on a nationwide basis.
Without this upfront cost advantage, it's likely that future buyers will opt for traditional gas- and diesel-powered vehicles due to the availability of ICE fueling infrastructure and opportunity cost. Whereas it takes just a few minutes to refuel an ICE vehicle, it can take an hour to a full day, depending on the type of charger used, to juice up an EV.
But wait -- there's more bad news
However, ending this lucrative tax credit that incentivized the purchase of EVs isn't the only way Donald Trump's big, beautiful bill is disrupting pure-play EV manufacturers.
When the president signed his flagship tax and spending bill into law on July 4, 2025, it put an end to corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) fines, as well as retroactively eliminated fines for 2022 model years and all subsequent years.
CAFE regulations represent the standard of how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. These figures, which are set by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, are designed to promote more fuel-efficient vehicles over time and lessen the reliance on fossil fuels. Automakers that failed to meet these standards were subject to fines. With CAFE civil penalties removed, courtesy of Trump's law, there's no longer any financial incentive for automakers to meet sky-high mile-per-gallon targets.
This is almost certain to have an adverse impact on the ability of Tesla, Rivian Automotive, and Lucid Group to generate profits.
Government agencies provide automotive regulatory credits to these pure-play EV manufacturers, which sell these tax credits to legacy automakers that are short of compliance targets. For Tesla especially, selling these tax credits plays a key role in its profitability. Without regulatory credits, Elon Musk's company would have reported a pre-tax loss during the first quarter of 2025.
With the teeth behind CAFE regulations removed by the big, beautiful bill, the market for automotive regulatory credits in the U.S. is going to be severely depressed. It has the potential to expose the fact that Wall Street's EV darling, Tesla, has been consistently generating more than half of its pre-tax income from unsustainable and/or non-innovative sources, such as selling automotive regulatory credits and earning interest income on its cash.
It'll also minimize regulatory tax credit revenue for Rivian and Lucid. Whereas Tesla has at least been profitable on a recurring basis for five consecutive years (with the help of automotive regulatory credits), Rivian and Lucid continue to lose money hand over fist as they ramp up operations and attempt to carve out their own unique niches in the automotive marketplace. Despite substantial cash piles for both companies and brand-name financial backing, long-term success is far from a guarantee.
Though I wouldn't go so far as to say Donald Trump drove a dagger through the heart of the EV industry, his actions are almost certain to thin the herd and make it considerably more difficult for pure-play electric-vehicle makers to compete with traditional ICE vehicles."

Two Stocks to Sell:
Lucid (LCID)
Consensus Price Target: $23.79 (-1.3% implied return)
Founded by a former Tesla Vice President, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) designs, manufactures, and sells luxury electric vehicles with long-range capabilities.
Why Are We Hesitant About LCID?
-
Negative 155% gross margin means it loses money on every sale and must pivot or scale quickly to survive
-
Cash-burning tendencies make us wonder if it can sustainably generate shareholder value
-
Depletion of cash reserves could lead to a fundraising event that triggers shareholder dilution
Lucid is trading at $24.11 per share, or 37.3x forward price-to-sales. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than LCID.
Eastern Bank (EBC)
Consensus Price Target: $20.20 (11.2% implied return)
Founded in 1818 as one of America's oldest mutual banks before converting to a public company in 2020, Eastern Bankshares (NASDAQ:EBC) operates as a bank holding company providing commercial and retail banking services primarily in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.
Why Do We Think Twice About EBC?
-
Annual revenue growth of 1.5% over the last five years was below our standards for the banking sector
-
Tangible book value per share tumbled by 6.8% annually over the last four years, showing banking sector trends are working against its favor during this cycle
-
Projected tangible book value per share decline of 5.5% for the next 12 months points to tough credit quality challenges ahead
Eastern Bank’s stock price of $18.16 implies a valuation ratio of 1.1x forward P/B. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why EBC doesn’t pass our bar.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has urged customers to lock in purchases ahead of the September 30 deadline for the Federal EV credit to avail the incentive, as Q3 deliveries look poised to exceed analyst estimates.
EV Credit Deadline Is Just Around The Corner
The company's North American handle posted on the social media platform X on Sunday, urging customers to lock in their purchase before the deadline. ""2 days left to lock in $7,500 fed tax credit,"" Tesla said in the post along with a link to the website.
The news comes as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revised the terms to avail the Federal EV Credit, with the agency now saying that customers can still avail the credit even if they take delivery of the vehicle post the deadline, provided that they make a nominal payment on or before September 30. A payment can include a small down payment as well as a trade-in, the IRS had said.
Meanwhile, Tesla had updated its terms, coinciding with the IRS's updates. However, the EV giant also mentioned that taking delivery beyond September 30 and still availing the IRA Credit is only valid for cash purchases. Customers leasing the vehicles would still be expected to take delivery on or before the deadline day.
Elsewhere, California Governor Gavin Newsom confirmed that the state wouldn't be pushing through with the proposed bespoke EV incentives after the Federal EV Credit deadline.
The state had earlier planned on offering incentives to EV owners via ""backfill."" Instead, California will now reportedly look towards improving the charging infrastructure in the state.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.
SoFi Alt Investments
SoFi gives membersaccess to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.
Range Wealth Management
Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold
For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides asimple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets."

At least eight cabinet departments comprising more than two-thirds of the federal workforce had detailed their shutdown plans as of Monday afternoon. Together they call for more than 400,000 employees to be sent home as nonessential.

But those plans contained only one reference to permanent staffing reduction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had 1,563 positions in “RIF status,” but it was unclear whether those reductions were previously authorized or part of the shutdown plan. Officials at the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment about the language in the CDC contingency plan.
The White House budget office told agencies last week to propose job cuts as part of their shutdown plans — a thinly veiled threat to congressional Democrats that President Donald Trump might permanently wind down unfunded programs rather than put them on pause.
The Office of Management and Budget did not respond to questions about why agency shutdown plans didn’t follow up on that directive.
Downsizing the federal workforce can be a time-consuming process. Under civil service rules, affected workers must be given notice and may have “bumping rights” that allow more senior employees whose positions are eliminated to take another job. Unionized workers may have additional protections.
That’s one reason why Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s government downsizing initiative used a voluntary deferred resignation program he called the “Fork in the Road.” About 150,000 federal employees accepted the offer of six months or more of pay in exchange for exiting their role. For most who accepted, those paychecks run out at the end of the fiscal year on Tuesday.
During a government shutdown, essential employees continue to work. Those include workers in law enforcement, safety inspections and other critical positions. The definition of essential can be broad, and includes IT employees needed to preserve data, scientists working on biological research and mortuary affairs workers in the Department of Defense."

Sep 29 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will report its third-quarter deliveries this week, and analysts are already weighing in with sharply different views.
HSBC analyst Michael Tyndall lifted his price target on TSLA stock to $127 from $120 but kept a Sell rating. Tyndall expects Q3 deliveries of around 471,000 vehicles, above consensus estimates of 437,000441,000 units.
He pointed to strong demand in Turkiye, boosted by favorable tax policies and the refreshed Model Y, though he cautioned that incentives in both Turkiye and Spain may not last.
Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg, meanwhile, maintained a Buy rating with a $475 price target. He forecasts Q3 deliveries of 442,000 vehicles, slightly below FactSet's 448,000-unit consensus. Legg noted that while sequential growth looks solid, uneven incentives and pricing trends could create volatility into year-end.
Is TSLA Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 44 analysts, the average target price for Tesla Inc is $326.02 with a high estimate of $600.00 and a low estimate of $19.05. The average target implies a downside of -25.96% from the current price of $440.31.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $266.09, suggesting a downside of -39.57% from the current price of $440.31."

Gold has smashed through fresh records this year, pushing the US Treasury's holdings past $1 trillion in market value, even as they remain frozen on the books at just $11 billion. The jump came as bullion traded above $3,824.50 an ounce on Monday, extending a 45% surge in 2025. Investors have been piling into the metal as a possible hedge against trade frictions, geopolitical uncertainty, and renewed Fed rate cuts. Spot prices later eased to $3,814.82 an ounce in London, but remain near record highs, keeping gold firmly in the spotlight.
The US sits on roughly 261.5 million ounces of gold, the largest stash globally, with more than half stored in Fort Knox and the rest spread across West Point, Denver, and the New York Fed. Yet the government continues to value those reserves at the 1973 price of $42.22 an ounce. Marking the hoard to today's prices could release close to $1 trillion into the Treasury, covering about half of the $1.973 trillion deficit through August. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has played down that possibility, but history shows that Germany and Italy have turned to similar revaluations.
The surge has also fueled fresh intrigue around Fort Knox itself. President Donald Trump and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk both questioned the vault's contents earlier this year, prompting Trump to say he wanted to make sure the gold is there. While officials insist the holdings remain intact, the mix of soaring valuations, political speculation, and fiscal strain has placed America's gold at the center of a broader debate over how far Washington might go in navigating its budget challenges."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) shares have rallied 32% in September, boosted by expectations of strong third-quarter deliveries and renewed enthusiasm from CEO Elon Musk ahead of the Nov. 6 annual general meeting.
Analysts at Barclays said the outperformance reflects not only fundamentals but also technical factors and retail investor sentiment, calling Tesla the original meme stock. Options activity, call buying, and excitement around the Magnificent Seven catch-up trade have also fueled momentum.
Barclays expects Tesla to beat delivery estimates in Q3 but cautioned the market may have already priced in that outcome. The stock is currently trading at about 180 times projected 2026 earnings, far above peers.
Still, analysts said the AGM could serve as another catalyst, highlighting Musk's increased engagement and Tesla's longer-term growth narrative."

""Tesla's forward-thinking approach to engineering inspired me to pursue innovation,"" Collins said. That early curiosity about how things work and how ideas become real-world solutions led him to enter math and physics competitions, tinker with machines and eventually pursue mechanical engineering at Howard University.
As a student, Collins joined the Cummins × NSBE Integrated Pipeline Program (IPP), which provided both a scholarship and an internship. His first internship in 2021 brought him to Cummins Turbo Technologies (CTT) as a Customer Application Engineer intern. A year later, he returned to work at Cummins as a Systems Engineer. After graduating in 2023, Collins joined Cummins full-time through the Engineering Development Program. His first rotation placed him in the engine business unit, where he supported OEM integration efforts for the B7.2 product. In June 2024, he transitioned into his current role as a Customer Application Engineer at CTT.
Today, Collins helps customers ensure that turbochargers are properly integrated and optimized for their specific applications. He works cross-functionally to review technical documentation, analyze performance data, support turbo builds and tests and ensure we meet all standards and customer expectations. ""The cool factor is seeing something you've worked on come to life-knowing that our solutions are making a real difference out there,"" he shared. ""Even while I'm still learning, I can see how my work contributes to something bigger.""
Collins currently works hybrid, spending two days a week in the office and the rest remotely. ""Office days are great for collaboration in the lab and test cell,"" he said. ""Remote days give me focused time to dig into technical details. It's a great balance."" He appreciates how leaders at Cummins emphasize trust and flexibility, focusing on outcomes rather than micromanaging schedules. That trust has helped him stay productive while maintaining energy and well-being outside of work.
Staying energized matters, and Collins makes a point of fueling his creativity beyond the office-curating music playlists, discovering new artists and traveling to experience different cultures. ""Those moments of inspiration and movement help me recharge and bring new perspective to my work,"" he said. He also keeps active with regular workouts and outdoor activities, which help him stay sharp throughout the week."

The world’s largest automaker by volume said global sales rose 2.2% in August year over year to nearly 845,000 units sold, with the company marking its eighth straight month of sales gains. Toyota’s year-to-date sales through August hit 6.9 million units, up 5% compared to last year.
The US, the largest market for the Japanese automaker, marked the biggest gains for Toyota.
Sales in August hit 225,367 units sold in the US, a 13.6% jump compared to a year ago. Year-to-date sales were up 7.2%, just above 1.68 million units sold.
“Sales were up year-on-year due to recovery from last year’s production stoppage caused by recalls of the [Lexus] TX and Grand Highlander as well as strong performance of hybrid vehicles such as Camry and RAV4,” Toyota said in its sales report.
Not surprisingly, the RAV4, the company’s top seller, and the ubiquitous Camry sedan led the sales gains.
In China, Toyota’s other major market, sales were essentially flat. The company cited an “ongoing severe market environment, including a shift to new energy vehicles and intensifying price competition,” as reasons for minimal growth. Toyota did say the company’s promotions tied to Chinese subsidies, as well as strong sales of Toyota’s bZ3X electric vehicle, helped its performance.
Turning back to the US, Toyota’s performance in August mirrored the success of other major automakers.
Ford (F) said US sales in August rose 3.9% compared to a year ago to 190,206 vehicles sold. Powering the gains were Ford SUVs, Maverick pickups, and EV sales, the company said.
Kia US sales jumped 10.4% year over year in August, with the EV9 SUV and Kia Sportage SUV having their best sales months ever.
Kia's sister brand, Hyundai, also said sales rose 12% to 88,523 vehicles, which the company said was its 11th straight month of sales gains and an August sales record.
Interestingly, automakers are seeing sales gains in the face of 25% sector tariffs for the auto industry and 15% tariffs on auto exports from Japan and South Korea.

Later this week, major automakers like GM (GM), Ford, and Tesla (TSLA) will report third quarter deliveries, which should reflect the past few months of strong sales.
The major question is how long the good times will last with tariffs now fully in place and the US federal tax credit for EVs ending on Sept. 30.

The auto industry is undergoing transformation, with electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) becoming mainstream and reshaping how people think about mobility. For years, Tesla TSLA dominated the EV conversation. Today, the field looks very different. Chinese rival BYD Co. Ltd BYDDY is challenging Tesla’s leadership, and traditional automakers are rapidly pivoting toward electrification. On top of that, pure-play EV startups are adding fresh competition and giving consumers more choice than ever.
A big reason behind this acceleration is government support. Many countries are offering subsidies, tax credits, and other incentives to encourage drivers to go electric. This push is backed by fast progress in technology. Improved battery technology has increased driving range, reduced costs and made EVs more appealing to a wider audience. The growth of fast-charging networks is also reducing one of the biggest barriers to adoption — charging time. Together, these changes are helping EVs shift from niche products to mass-market options.
The numbers reflect the momentum. According to EV Volumes, global EV sales climbed 25% in 2024 to 17.8 million units. That figure is expected to reach 21.3 million in 2025, giving EVs nearly a quarter of all auto sales. By 2030, annual sales could more than double to 40.1 million.
Regional trends show interesting dynamics. Europe is on track for EVs to make up 63% of sales by 2030, China has already crossed the halfway mark this year, and emerging markets across Asia and Latin America are catching up quickly. North America lags due to tariffs and weaker incentives but is expected to rebound toward the end of the decade. Battery demand, meanwhile, is projected to top 1 TWh in 2025—underscoring how quickly electrification is scaling up.
At the same time, AV development is progressing. Advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, sensors and connectivity are making AVs smarter and safer. Companies like Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo, Baidu’s BIDU Apollo Go, and Tesla are racing to bring AV technology to roads, with robotaxis and driverless fleets no longer just concepts. Per Statista, the global AV market, valued at about $106 billion in 2021, could soar to more than $2.3 trillion by 2030.
For investors, the EV and AV space represents growth, innovation, and long-term potential. If you want to tap it, our Electric Vehicles & Autonomous Driving Screen will help you to spot high-potential stocks in this space. Interested investors should add QuantumScape Corp. QS, Nissan Motor Co. NSANY and Blue Bird Corporation BLBD to their portfolio."

Barclays analysts said in a note Monday that the rally reflects “favorable near-term fundamental datapoints around deliveries / 3Q EPS, and perhaps more importantly around excitement into the Nov 6 AGM plus an increasingly engaged Elon.’”
Barclays argued that the stock’s outperformance is not just about fundamentals.
“We believe the rally can also be put in context of Tesla as the ‘OG meme stonk,’ with performance also reflecting a combination of technical factors (i.e. option activity / call purchasing), retail excitement, and Mag7 catch-up,” the analysts wrote.
The mix of excitement and positioning has pushed Tesla’s valuation higher. The analysts noted that “these trends have magnified the ongoing disconnect between the stock and near-term earnings power, with the stock trading at a frothy 180x ’26 PE multiple.”
Looking ahead, Barclays expects Tesla to deliver strong third-quarter numbers. “We reiterate our expectation for Tesla to beat on 3Q deliveries,” the note said.
However, the firm suggested the market may already be pricing in that outcome and warned that “we wouldn’t be surprised if there is a near-term breather.”
Still, Barclays highlighted that the upcoming shareholder meeting could provide another catalyst.
“Beyond the deliveries print, we think excitement could continue to build into the Nov 6 AGM, which we expect will highlight Elon Musk’s increased engagement with Tesla and excitement on a supercharged growth narrative ahead,” the analysts said.
Barclays concluded that Tesla’s September rally can be explained by “re-engaged Elon, favorable datapoints, and the return of the ‘OG meme stonk.’”

CNBC ‘Fast Money’ trader Dan Nathan said in a recent program that he’s turned bullish on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) despite overall weak sentiment and the company’s auto business showing soft trends. Here is why he thinks the stock can rally:
“The bulls and the bears agree that the EV business is bad. I think the consensus for Q3 deliveries is probably low. I think there’s probably been a pull forward. If you think about that $7,500 tax credit that’s going away at the end of the month and look at how this stock, we just want to pull the chart up here. It looks like it’s a beneficiary of this rotation. You know, look at all of the MAG7 names. The rotation in the MAG7. They basically all other than Apple today underperformed the NASDAQ. So, if you look at this thing, it’s built this base a series of higher lows here. It’s right up against that resistance level from a few months ago. It’s held its 200 day moving average. might you see this thing rally into quarter end? October 1st, 2nd, I think is when they’re going to report Q3 delivery. So, I think from a trading perspective, it looks very interesting.”

Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Well, let's start with CoreWeave. After a 200% rally this year following its IPO, the Gen AI cloud platform had some setbacks last week, as you can tell from this chart. But it's trending higher again this morning. Around up two and a half percent up in the pre-market actually. Now, the impressive lineup of now down just under 2% actually now. Now, the impressive lineup of partners, think Alphabet, Cloudfare, Cloudflare and of course Nvidia, keeps powering CoreWeave's rise along with strong revenue growth and positive indicators.
Okay, let's now move on to the farmer sector, which has been in the news in recent days with new tariffs and rules. Well, today, AstraZeneca is gaining some value after announcing plans to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, AstraZeneca said it would be maintaining its status as a UK listed and headquartered company, but it's hoping to attract a broader base of investors via a New York listing.
Two more stocks to know about. GSK is up as it announced a new CEO, Luke Miels. He'll replace Emma Walmsley in January. And UCB SA, it's a very big European company you may never have heard of. It's flying this morning after it presented presented positive trial results for several of its drugs.
Finally, let's move on to electric vehicles and China's BYD, that's Tesla's main competitor in the EV space. Well, it's rallied today in Hong Kong after it reported that it expects to export up to 1 million vehicles. That's roughly 20% of its total sales in 2025. It's good news for the EV maker even as it lowered its overall sales targets.
And in the United States as well, the EV industry is in the spotlight. As you may have heard, a $7,500 tax credit is set to end tomorrow, September 30th. Some EV shoppers race to buy their vehicles this weekend. But the Tesla stock, well, it seems a bit unscathed this morning. Kevin Roberts from CarGurus, well he spoke to my colleague, Josh Lipton.
I can say from our data, you can see that the sales rate has picked up. and then not only that, the amount of, you know, the number of EVs on dealer lots has been declining and the market day supply has dropped quite significantly. Uh from where we were, you know, at the end of June, 108 days supply, and now we're under 45 days supply. So, the message is clearly getting out to consumers and they're looking to kind of snap up those EVs before that credit expires.
So that bottom line, Kevin. So, you know, now let's let's look ahead. So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball. What what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin? What what would you expect to see?
So, it's it's unknown. I I've been taking a look at what happened in other markets where tax credits expired. And if you look to Europe, you know, you saw double digit declines, uh of EV sales afterwards. Uh California is one we've been watching. They accounted for about 30% of EV sales last year. And there had been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit. So a large EV market that we could be seeing uh a drop in sales volume in.
Are there certain EV names, Kevin, EV makers that in your opinion, hey, these guys, they they may be better positioned than others in a sort of a post tax credit world.
So, normally I would have assumed that automakers might be looking to plug the gap themselves, but we're in a post-tariff environment and that tariff tax bill they're currently consuming mostly themselves right now. So I don't know how much automakers are going to be able to really kind of foot the bill uh as those EV tax credits go away.
And Kevin, by the way, what what does the the used market for EVs look like? Do you have line of sight there?
Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit. It's for vehicles under $25,000. So we've been seeing an acceleration in that market as well. Not as much as what we've been seeing in the new vehicle market, but there has been an uptick uh in that used EV market and we've been seeing a lot more used EVs particularly get under that $25,000 threshold. And so it's a small but growing market."

Investors are enthusiastic about the company's innovative product pipeline, which includes an autonomous robotaxi called the Cybercab and a humanoid robot called Optimus. In fact, CEO Elon Musk believes these new platforms will make Tesla the most valuable company in the world one day.
But 74% of the company's revenue still comes from selling passenger electric vehicles (EVs) like the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck. Unfortunately, sales have plummeted this year as manufacturers of affordable EVs are snatching market share from Tesla in many key markets around the world.
On or around Oct. 2, Tesla will tell investors how many EVs it delivered to customers during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30). According to Wall Street, the number will be a slight improvement over the first- and second-quarter figures, so should investors buy Tesla stock ahead of the release?
Tesla's EV deliveries likely shrank yet again
Tesla delivered 720,803 EVs during the first half of 2025, which was down 13% from the same period last year. This led to a 14% decline in the company's revenue and a 31% crash in its earnings during the same period, which is concerning because the EV business supplies the cash flow to develop new products like the Cybercab and Optimus.
Competition is the main reason for Tesla's sluggish sales. In Europe, for example, the company's sales plunged by 36% year over year during August, despite EV sales growing by 30% in the region overall. In other words, Tesla is rapidly losing market share to other brands.
China-based BYD is one of those brands. Its sales tripled across Europe during August, as its low-cost EVs resonated with consumers who are increasingly budget conscious.
Wall Street's consensus estimate suggests Tesla delivered around 445,000 EVs worldwide during Q3, which would be down 3.9% from the year-ago period. While that is a shallower decline than the company experienced in the previous two quarters, it's mainly because analysts predict American consumers were front-running the end of the $7,500 EV tax credit, which expires on Oct. 1.
In other words, some of Tesla's third-quarter sales might have been pulled forward from the fourth quarter, which could lead to a much weaker result to close out the year.
It's still early days for Tesla's new products
Investors who are banking on the success of Tesla's other product platforms might be waiting a while. The company's full self-driving (FSD) software isn't approved for unsupervised use anywhere in the U.S. right now, and without clearing that hurdle, the Cybercab robotaxi won't be hauling any passengers when it hits the road next year.
In the meantime, Tesla is scaling up its autonomous robotaxi business using its passenger EVs. These cars are fitted with a supervised version of FSD, which requires a human safety officer in the passenger seat who can take control if necessary. This places Tesla behind competitors like Alphabet's Waymo, which is already completing over 250,000 paid, fully autonomous trips every week across five U.S. cities.
Moving onto the Optimus humanoid robot, Musk predicts this product platform will bring in a staggering $10 trillion in revenue for Tesla over the long term. He thinks humanoids could outnumber humans by 2040, because of their versatility in both business and household settings.
However, like the Cybercab, Optimus is still a while away from making a real contribution to Tesla's financial results. Musk expects production to start next year, but he says it could take five years to reach the company's target output of 1 million units annually.
Should you buy Tesla stock before Oct. 2?
Declining EV deliveries aside, I think there is an even bigger reason to be cautious about Tesla stock ahead of Oct. 2: its valuation.
The stock trades at a sky-high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 244, making it 7 times more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 technology index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.6. It also makes Tesla the priciest stock in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which is a group of tech giants leading various segments of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom:
High valuations are typically reserved for companies generating significant growth. Since Tesla's earnings are currently shrinking, its premium to the Magnificent Seven is extremely difficult to justify. In my opinion, this leaves the stock open to a significant potential decline in the future, especially if there are bumps along the way to commercializing the Cybercab and Optimus.
Therefore, it probably isn't a wise decision to buy Tesla stock ahead of Oct. 2, and it might be best to avoid it until those new products are officially generating revenue."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk made his foray into politics by spending more than a quarter of a billion dollars to support Donald Trump and the Republicans in 2024. Then, while already spread thin, he took a hiatus from Tesla and managed the ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ DOGE to help seek a solution to America’s soaring debt.
However, Musk would soon learn the reality of getting involved in politics in today’s toxic environment. Many democrats felt that Musk wielded too much power, leading to mass left-wing protests against Tesla, boycotts, and widespread vandalism. As if that weren’t bad enough, Musk had a ugly falling out with President Trump, leading to backlash from many partisans on the right. Meanwhile, Tesla’s legacy EV business was slowing, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) ‘Waymo’ seemed poised to dominate the robotaxi market, and even some of Musk’s staunchest followers began to lose faith in him, voicing concerns that he was no longer interested in running Tesla.
Tesla is on Pace for its Best September Performance Ever
However, if there’s one lesson Tesla has taught investors, it’s never to make a long-term bet against Elon Musk and Tesla, no matter how bad things may seem. Despite the slew of bearish headlines and negative earnings growth, TSLA is about to register its best September in history. Tesla shares up more than 30% in September and registered fresh all-time closing highs last week.

Why are Tesla Shares Rising?
Tesla shares are rising for several reasons. The September rally was sparked when Elon Musk confirmed that he was done with politics. For investors, the news was a massive sigh of relief. The importance of Musk’s presence at Tesla was put on full display when he stepped away from Tesla to focus on his acquisition of social media platform Twitter, and TSLA shares dropped swiftly. In addition to Musk leaving politics, investors also cheered the Tesla board’s $1 trillion pay package proposal for Musk, seeing the offer as a way to keep Musk at Tesla and motivated.
Tesla shareholders are once again betting on the future. Tesla’s robotaxi service is finally live in Austin and San Francisco, with plans to expand into other cities like Miami and Chicago (pending regulatory approval). In addition, TSLA shares are rising on optimism surrounding its newest ‘Full Self Driving’ (FSD) update, which is slated to launch this week. Tesla FSD v14 will be launched to a limited number of social media influencers this week, with v14.2 set to follow in a few weeks. In a recent tweet, Musk hyped the debut, saying that “The car will feel like it is sentient being by 14.2.”"
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-28T22:16:00,Is This a Red Flag for Tesla's Upcoming Q3 Deliveries Update?,Fresh Europe data on August Tesla registrations wasn't pretty.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=02d06c46573aabf76e7775cf9d30c3d8873c492db782e6fe9d9270ac1775e0ad,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/is-this-a-red-flag-for-teslas-upcoming-q3-deliveri/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/is-this-a-red-flag-for-teslas-upcoming-q3-deliveri/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/is-this-a-red-flag-for-teslas-upcoming-q3-deliveri/,fool.com,200,,"Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) shares fell more than 4% last Thursday as investors digested disappointing Tesla vehicle registration data in Europe ahead of the company's third-quarter deliveries update expected in early October. The electric vehicle maker sells premium battery-electric cars and energy storage products globally, with meaningful exposure to the European market.
The market's question now is simple: Does the regional weakness point to a poor quarter, or is it mostly noise inside a broader and still-uncertain recovery?
The latest Europe read was weak
News out Thursday showed Tesla's European Union registrations fell about 37% year over year in August to roughly 8,200 vehicles, marking a second straight month in which the China-based BYD outsold Tesla in the bloc. Including the broader European region (the U.K., Norway, and other EFTA countries), Tesla still led in absolute units for August, but registrations were down about 22% year over year, underscoring persistent pressure in the region.
This softness in Europe follows a tough second quarter for the electric car maker. In Q2, Tesla delivered just over 384,000 vehicles -- down 13% from about 444,000 in the year-ago period.
It is also worth recalling the company's tone on the latest earnings call. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that the near term may not be smooth, noting that things could get ""rough"" before they get better over the next few quarters. While that comment doesn't guarantee weak third-quarter deliveries, it frames Tesla's headlines about European deliveries within management's own caution about the path back to growth.
Setting expectations for Q3
With only days left in the period when the August Europe data hit the tape, the right way to think about Q3 is probably through a conservative range, not a single-point guess. Start with what we know: Tesla delivered about 384,000 vehicles in the second quarter, it delivered roughly 463,000 in last year's third quarter, and outside Europe there are mixed but not universally negative signals. Some trackers have flagged improving weekly registrations in parts of Europe late in September, and several outlooks have pointed to steadier demand in China and the U.S., even as Europe stays choppy. Still, Europe's August decline argues for caution.
A reasonable, conservative estimate for Q3 deliveries is 430,000 to 455,000. The low end assumes Europe remains a drag through quarter-end and that China/U.S. improvement only partly offsets it. The high end assumes late-September sequential gains in key markets and typical quarter-end logistics help. That range sits close to widely cited expectations near the mid-440,000s and acknowledges both the seasonal lift from Q2 and the regional weakness that surfaced this week. For reference, landing near 445,000 would be down modestly year over year versus the roughly 463,000 delivered in last year's third quarter.
Of course, in the end, no one knows where deliveries will come from. Further, note that this is a conservative estimate. There's always a chance that deliveries could come in above this range (or even below).
Meanwhile, the stock's valuation doesn't help the bull case. At a market value well above $1 trillion and with a price-to-earnings ratio of 252 as of this writing, the stock embeds high expectations well beyond one quarter's deliveries. Such a high valuation leaves less cushion if third-quarter deliveries disappoint, or if commentary points to rough demand trends going into year-end.
Of course, there are some significant positives for investors to consider, too. Energy storage deployments remain a bright spot. Furthermore, a recent Model Y refresh, advancements in self-driving technology, and a planned upcoming vehicle launch could all contribute to increased demand in the second half of the year. But given this fresh data on Tesla registrations in the E.U., it's fair to say that risk sits a bit higher heading into next week's update.
The bigger story, anyway, will be a forward-looking one. Investors should look for any insight management provides on how quickly it thinks deliveries can reaccelerate. Because sales are going to need to pick up sharply at some point in order for Tesla's fundamentals to live up to its stock price."

Ford Motor Co. is capitalizing on an NFL moment to get both good marketing and make sure no one confuses Detroit Lions wide receiver Isaac TeSlaa for, er, the other automaker that makes electric vehicles: Tesla.
The Ford family, which has ownership stakes in Ford Motor Co. and also own the Lions, therefore, the automaker decided to gift the wide receiver a new all-electric 2025 F-150 Lightning in silver. On Monday, Ford spokesman Dan Barbossa said the vehicle is only a loan as part of TeSlaa's ""ambassadorship"" with the company.
Barbossa said, ""TeSlaa’s electric NFL debut has caught everyone’s attention — even Ford. Now, Ford is making sure that despite his last name, TeSlaa’s wheels are undeniably Ford.""
Ford delivered the new vehicle to TeSlaa over the weekend and he drove it to Ford Field ahead of the game against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, Sept. 28. In a statement to the Free Press, TeSlaa said just being a part of the Lions and connected to Ford is a dream come true.
""I was thrilled when Ford approached me,"" TeSlaa said. ""Growing up, I always dreamed of playing at Ford Field and now that I’m in the league, it feels full circle.
""I’ve been a Ford fan my whole life, and I’m excited to be driving my new F-150 Lightning. I’m excited to keep chasing this dream and see where it takes me.”
TeSlaa has had an incredible start to the season, making two amazing one-handed catches during his first two NFL games.
The Detroit Lions are run by Sheila Ford Hamp, who is the sister of Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor Co. Their father, William Clay Ford Sr., the grandson of Ford founder Henry Ford, bought the team in 1963, and it has remained in the Ford family's control since.
Barbossa said TeSlaa received a Platinum edition Lightning, which according to Ford's website, starts at $84,995. It comes standard with the extended-range battery and dual motors for high performance, plus Nirvana leather seats, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, and a panoramic moonroof. It includes Ford's hands-free BlueCruise driving system and Pro Power Onboard. which can turn the vehicle into a mobile generator.
Last month, Ford presented New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso with a new F-150 in recognition of breaking the New York Mets home run record with 253 career homeruns. Darryl Strawberry had long held the record with 252 home runs.

At one point, shares were down nearly 40%. After a huge rally, however, shares are now up in value by 13% on the year.
What's in store for 2026? There are three major moving pieces every electric car stock investor should be monitoring.
Can robotaxis create $1 trillion in value for Tesla in 2026?
Some experts are extremely bullish on Tesla's robotaxi opportunity. This summer, the company launched a pilot version of the long-awaited autonomous taxi service in Austin, Texas. The launch came after nearly a decade of promises from CEO Elon Musk. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives was immediately impressed. ""Going into it, we expected to be impressed,"" he told clients after trying the service out personally. ""But walking away from it, all there is to say is that this is the future."" He thinks robotaxis could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026.
Major Tesla investor Cathie Wood, meanwhile, thinks that the global opportunity for robotaxis could eventually be worth $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Wood predicts that robotaxis will account for 90% of Tesla's value by 2030, a year in which she thinks Tesla's share price will surpass $2,500.
The market is excited about Tesla's robotaxi dreams. They're a big reason why shares trade at such a lofty premium to competitors like Rivian and Lucid Group. But the road will be difficult. After several months, Tesla has yet to expand its robotaxi service beyond Austin, Texas. The existing service, meanwhile, is geofenced to a fairly limited area. The company reportedly has been planning a San Francisco expansion, but regulators have yet to sign off on any real-world plans.
It will likely take years for Tesla's own technology to catch up to its promises. The robotaxi service in Texas, for instance, still uses human overseers during operation. Confusingly, Musk has told Bay Area officials that Tesla's service launch in that region will not involve autonomous vehicles.
Whatever the case, it's possible that investor enthusiasm could force Tesla's market cap above $2 trillion by the end of 2026. But this rise likely won't stem from huge leaps and bounds in real-world adoption.
Don't expect either of these game-changers next year
We have a bit more clarity on two things not to expect from Tesla in 2026.
Earlier this year, the U.S. government ended several electric vehicle subsidies. First, it axed a tax credit for buyers of EVs, a credit worth up to $7,500 per purchase. This move will almost certainly suppress EV demand next year. The second subsidy the government ended dealt with automotive regulatory credits. These credits were earned by selling low-emission vehicles, and then sold at nearly 100% profit margins to manufacturers that did not produce enough low-emission vehicles.
For more than a decade, Tesla has generated billions in extra profit from the sale of these credits. Starting next year, newly acquired credits will have essentially zero value. That's because fines for non-compliance will be eliminated, taking away any incentive for other manufacturers to purchase Tesla's credits.
Without these two subsidies -- both of which provide meaningful contributions to Tesla's top and bottom lines -- 2026 could be a doozy. This is on top of a weak year for Tesla, with sales expected to fall by 5% this fiscal year.
Which factor will the market value most -- rising robotaxi ambitions, or financial pressure in Tesla's core business? The answer to this question will likely explain the movement of shares next year."

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-28T14:45:00,Better Electric Vehicle (EV) Stock: Lucid vs. Rivian,Both Rivian and Lucid have exciting growth journeys ahead.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b5398b3972fbd47dd8277c956d7bad5390c9d13aa757819b9ea6b5a5fd3ea412,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/better-electric-vehicle-ev-stock-lucid-vs-rivian/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/better-electric-vehicle-ev-stock-lucid-vs-rivian/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/better-electric-vehicle-ev-stock-lucid-vs-rivian/,fool.com,200,,"Investors have long searched for the next Tesla (TSLA 1.39%). It's no wonder why. Since 2010, Tesla shares have increased in value by more than 34,000%.
Two of the most popular electric vehicle (EV) stocks today are Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.17%) and Lucid Group (LCID -1.23%). Both have similarities to Tesla, but only one stock looks like a clear winner today. Let's determine which one.
This is how Tesla became a $1.3 trillion business
But first let's look at the industry leader. How did Tesla become one of the greatest investments of all time? There are two major pillars supporting the company's valuation today.
The first is Tesla's dominant position in the EV space. Last year, no company in the world produced more battery-powered electric vehicles than Tesla. How did it get this way? Just take a look at Tesla's production statistics. More than 90% of Tesla's production stemmed from just two models: The Model 3 and the Model Y.
It's no coincidence that both of these models have starting prices under $50,000. Nearly 70% of American car buyers are looking to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle purchase. Getting vehicles to market under this price point is critical, though most EV producers have struggled to achieve this goal.
For now, neither Rivian nor Lucid has any affordable models for sale. But that could change as early as next year when Rivian starts production of three new vehicles, all of which should have starting prices under $50,000. Lucid has teased new affordable models for years, but actual deliveries likely won't begin until 2027 at the earliest.
The second pillar underpinning Tesla's gargantuan valuation is its exposure to massive growth areas like robotaxis. Some experts believe this could be a $5 trillion to $10 trillion opportunity. One Wall Street analyst even thinks that Tesla's valuation will soar to $2 trillion by the end of 2026 based on robotaxi growth alone.
Tesla shares trade at 15.8 times sales despite declining revenue. Rivian, meanwhile, trades at just 3.7 times sales, while Lucid shares trade at roughly 7.6 times sales. Why such a premium for Tesla stock? The likely reason is Tesla's ability to pursue huge growth opportunities like robotaxis, even if that growth remains hypothetical today.
For now, neither Lucid nor Rivian has any plans to operate a robotaxi service themselves. But Lucid does have a partnership with Uber Technologies to supply it with 20,000 vehicles to power that company's robotaxi business. Rivian, meanwhile, has been fairly quiet about its robotaxi plans, though the company has invested heavily in autonomous driving features.
Will Rivian or Lucid become the next Tesla?
When it comes to mimicking Tesla's rise, the two keys seem to be the production of low-cost vehicles and the ability to pursue massive growth opportunities like robotaxis. Rivian has a lead in the former category, while Lucid seemingly has a lead in the latter category. From an investment standpoint, which is the better stock today? Rivian looks like the winner here.
Don't get me wrong: Lucid's exposure to the robotaxi market is exciting. But the company is simply a supplier, not an operator. It has far less to gain than robotaxi operators like Tesla or Uber. The company also skipped a step in Tesla's master growth plan: Getting affordable vehicles to market.
This is where Rivian has a heavy lead. The company should have affordable vehicles on the roads by early 2026. Management has been very clear that the production schedule remains on track. Lucid, however, has provided far fewer details. Its relatively smaller access to capital, meanwhile, could hinder its ability to scale production.
With Rivian shares trading at a 50% discount to Lucid on a price-to-sales basis, I'm sticking with the cheaper stock that has a more defined growth path in the year to come."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-28T12:31:00,Tesla Is About to Launch a New Vehicle. It May Be a Game-Changer.,A lower-priced Tesla built for autonomy could reaccelerate demand and deepen the company's software story.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7cddb5d88d2f7f8a4ea0404a766bf6bfd08a54ec9841db5e54bdb71991b9e86b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/tesla-is-about-to-launch-a-new-vehicle-it-may-be-a/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/tesla-is-about-to-launch-a-new-vehicle-it-may-be-a/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/tesla-is-about-to-launch-a-new-vehicle-it-may-be-a/,fool.com,200,,"Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) is quietly approaching a product milestone that could dramatically catalyze its business: a new, more affordable vehicle designed to expand its addressable market and support its autonomy ambitions. Fortunately for investors, Tesla is no stranger to step-change launches -- and this one arrives amid a broader pivot the company has outlined toward artificial intelligence (AI) and software.
But what do we actually know about this vehicle? And, more importantly, could it move the needle like Model 3 did years ago?
What we know (and don't) about the new vehicle
""We continue to expand our vehicle offering, including first builds of a more affordable model in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025,"" Tesla said in its second-quarter update.
During the accompanying earnings call for its second quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested that the new vehicle is essentially a variant of the Model Y. Some speculate it may be a stripped-down version or have a smaller battery or both.
Where could the vehicle be priced compared to the rest of Tesla's lineup? Today's U.S. Model Y starts at about $45,000 -- above pricing that many shoppers target. An ""affordable"" trim suggests a meaningful discount to current Model Y stickers, likely enabled by a smaller battery, simplified interiors, and scale savings on parts shared with the refreshed Model Y (Juniper).
What about design? It would not be surprising to see the budget variant borrow many of the refresh cues from the recently overhauled Model Y.
To be fair, we're just speculating here. We only know it will be less expensive than Tesla's current lineup (Otherwise, why call it ""a more affordable model""?) -- so, probably somewhere in the $30,000 range.
The specific timing also remains unknown, but if Tesla still expects to achieve volume production of the new vehicle this year, then the first deliveries will likely occur soon.
Why this could still be a big deal
Model 3, which was Tesla's first vehicle priced well below its flagship Model S and X vehicles, significantly increased Tesla's deliveries. After its first Model 3 deliveries in the second half of 2017, Tesla scaled to approximately 368,000 deliveries in 2019 (up from just 76,000 in 2016) and then nearly 500,000 in 2020 as Model 3 volumes ramped and the 2020-launched similarly priced Model Y came into play as well, laying the foundation for the company's 1.8 million deliveries in 2023. That history illustrates how a lower entry price can unlock latent demand.
This new vehicle probably won't drive a Model 3-like step change by itself, but it could strengthen two important vectors. The first, of course, is affordability. A credible Tesla, under the current Model 3 and Y price points, addresses a widening gap in the electric vehicle market as interest rates make affordability more challenging.
The second way this new, more affordable vehicle can help unlock more demand is with autonomy. Tesla continues to frame its future in terms of AI, software, and fleet-based profits -- and recent steps toward an autonomous ride-sharing service suggest the next wave of vehicles will be built with self-driving in mind from day one. A budget Tesla that's full self-driving ready gives owners a potential path to deploy their cars into Tesla's planned Robotaxi network when regulations and software allow.
The investment lens, then, is about magnitude and timing. Near term, Tesla continues to face challenges as sales have dipped. In the second quarter, deliveries were down year over year. However, a late-2025 volume ramp for an affordable, autonomy-ready Tesla could stabilize unit trends while reinforcing the company's software narrative, which is crucial for valuation.
Tesla trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 250, reflecting expectations for faster growth and an expanding profit margin, driven by growing software-based sales. While a successful launch of Tesla's upcoming, more affordable model doesn't guarantee those outcomes, it likely improves the odds that today's premium proves defensible."

Here’s what went down 25 years ago that ultimately burst the dot-com boom
The comparison between today’s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions—minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone—and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself?
The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America’s biggest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure.
Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. “
Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”
But what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today’s AI boom? Let’s take a stroll down memory lane—or, if you weren’t born yet, some plain ole history.
The perfect storm of 2000
The dot-com crash wasn’t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds.
The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies.
But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy."

Road trips are not all about gas guzzling campers anymore. New wave of electric RVs are making their way into camp grounds. a new RV startup called Lightship, co-founded by a former Tesla battery engineer offers trailers that power themselves on the road and run on battery and solar at the campsite. Join me now, we got Lightship co-founder and chief product officer, Ben Parker. Ben, it is great to see you on set. So maybe start big picture, Ben, just for the the uninitiated who are listening right now. Explain a little bit about Lightship,
the problem you all are solving for, what makes you sort of different than the competition? What separates you?
Yeah, I mean, well, Josh, nice to Good to meet you man.
Good to see you.
Thanks for having us. We uh I I would say that the RV is uh it's an American icon, the you know, it's a passtime that so many Americans love. 10% of the country, believe it or not, uh own an RV. So this is this is huge, you know, huge part of Americana. And yet RVs in a lot of ways have not changed in 20, 30, maybe 40 years. And so I thought, my co-founder thought, um he was also Tesla that it was uh it was time for a big refresh of the RV. The world has changed a lot over the past 20 or 30 years and we thought it was time to bring bring RVs up to date and into this, you know, this this new age of digitization, electrification, and still keep um, you know, the the the most beautiful parts of camping the the same that they've always been. I think in some ways camping
is even better in such a, you know, an action packed world today than, um, than in decades past.
Let me I I totally agree with you. We think RVs is America as it gets. I mean it's like like baseball games, barbecue and RVs, right? How fast though, Ben, I'm just curious, how fast is that market growing?
Well, I think the, um, numbers would tell you it's 5 to 7% a year and has been for a long time. Maybe the more of the story behind it is that um RVing is just been um it's it's been a big part of our the American experience for a long time, but it's been steadily on this on this uptick. More and more people are um sort of wanting wanting to get back to nature and have great, you know, great great natural experiences. We were talking about about COVID off air. It really accelerated during COVID. So so many people in you know, our generation, millennial generation, um got to experience RVing for the first time and we're we're converted
by it and uh, yeah, the the the great American road trip is alive and well. It's just uh it's it's getting better and we're trying to try to um hasten that.
What are the benefits then? If you explain like an electric RV as opposed to your traditional gas guzzler? Is it just is it is it because it's cleaner, it's quieter? Like what are the advantages?
Well, one um one thing to explain up front is that what we build at Lightship is a towable RV. So there RVs are towable and drivable, drivable, you know, you got the steering wheel, usually called a motor home as well. Towables are the RVs that you hitch behind your your truck and pull. Um about about 90% of RVs sold in the US are towable because uh Americans love big big trucks and SUVs. And so once you've got that, you know, that love affair, the the towable
follows. Um what what sets us apart in the in the type of towable that we build is that we um took our background from places like Tesla, where my my co-founder and I found our our start. He he led the finance team there. I was a battery engineer there. Um other other new automotive startups that have since grown big, places like Rivian, Lucid and applied what we had learned there to this new space. So we took a ground up approach, we thought about um if you're starting from scratch, what should a towable RV behave like? And what came out if uh if people go to our our website, lightshiprv.com
is uh basically a road-going spaceship. This this thing looks, it's not your grandfather's RV, although we do have a lot of grandpas who are who are excited about it. It looks totally unique. It's got this really streamlined aerodynamic shape when you're towing it, which we call the road mode and then the whole body of the of the vehicle expands to be double the size when you get to the the campground. So you get this really awesome spacious uh living space with panoramic wraparound windows. You know, if you're in a beautiful place like a national park, you catch the the full vista. Maybe half dome is right right in front of you in in Yosemite. The entire roof
of the RV is covered in solar. So we integrate solar panels right into the the shape of the lightship and then in the floor, we pack a giant uh EV battery. It's this it's a battery that is the same size as you would find in something like a a Tesla Model 3 or or a Model Y. So you know, really big, 50 to 100 times as big as what you'd find in a in a traditional RV and we can use that solar plus the battery to power all of your appliances on board. So if you're off grid, you can just keep camping for days and not worry about running out of power. We even use that same EV battery to power a motor on the trailer. So this this is this is something that makes a lightship a totally new class of of vehicle. It is a self-propelling trailer. It acts a little bit like an e-bike in the sense that the motor on the trailer assists
the truck that's pulling it. So the truck doesn't feel the weight of the lightship as it's it's pulling it down the road, which is pretty impressive because it's a 27 ft long, you know, close to 8,000 pound vehicle when it's fully loaded and that truck if it's a a gas or a diesel truck, will keep its normal highway fuel economy and get great kind of hybrid performance.
Let me ask you, Ben, how much does this all cost?
It's um we I would say we we are starting uh at a in a premium segment of the market. It's not it's not priced to infinity. We we are What does premium mean, Ben?
Premium means $100 to $200,000. We we start at $125 and you can option up a lightship into the into the high hundreds. So you would compare it, um if you're thinking about products that are out there today, it's something like an Airstream. It's a, you know, it's a really nice nice trailer. Now, of course our ambition is to to grow big and make Lightship a a household brand name.
Does that mean more does that would that necessarily mean Ben relatively smaller more affordable models on the way at some point?
Yes. This this is the beginning. People RV in a lot of different ways and um there need to be different access points to to get into a lightship. And so um we're thinking about all the ways that we can offer people that that experience including a lineup of products.
Ben, I got to tell you, that that VO makes me want an RV. Thank you, man. for coming in. Appreciate it.
Let's uh let's go on a road trip.
I would love to. Thank you, sir.
Thanks."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-28T09:10:00,My Honest Opinion of Tesla Stock,Elon Musk's company is leading the race that all the major automakers have entered.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bbe0d6a1a1475fa271987750939fa1cef04e0ec5958d1397cdfc8cd8f60ad6ba,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/my-honest-opinion-of-tesla-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/my-honest-opinion-of-tesla-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/my-honest-opinion-of-tesla-stock/,fool.com,200,,"Investing in Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) these days requires a reset of investor perspectives on what the company is and what kind of industry it operates in. Keeping that premise in mind, here's one view of Tesla, its industry, and the investment proposition for the stock.
The auto industry is changing
Traditionally, investors viewed the auto industry as a highly competitive, mature, low-growth, and relatively low-margin sector, and accorded stocks in the industry the kind of low valuations that such stocks deserve. After all, having to develop new models every five to seven years and refresh them every few years is costly, as consumer preferences change and competitors introduce new models. Additionally, automakers strive to generate revenue from after-sales services, encompassing financing, parts, and maintenance.
However, this traditional business model is challenged by EVs for the following reasons:
- Investment in EVs challenges profit margins even further, as it requires investment in batteries, new production processes, and supply chains.
- The dramatically lower service and maintenance costs make it much harder to generate income from parts and maintenance.
As such, if EVs are the future, and an automaker wants to remain relevant to that future, then it must find a way to reduce the upfront costs of EVs. It also needs to develop a way of generating recurring after-sales revenue. Tesla thinks it has the answer to both questions.
Tesla's solutions
Recognizing that EVs will have relatively higher upfront costs but significantly lower fueling and maintenance costs compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, the auto industry's solution is to capitalize on the natural economic advantages of EVs, which distinguish them from ICE cars. The following table helps summarize matters.
| Electric vehicles | Internal Combustion Engines | |
|---|---|---|
| Upfront costs | High | Low |
| Fueling costs | Low | Higher (depending on oil prices) |
| Maintenance costs | Low | High |
| Economic value generation | Run often over many years | Lower upfront costs |
Tesla has three solutions.
- Lower the upfront cost of ownership by building scale in EV sales volumes (to enable it to reduce the relatively high cost per vehicle and, in turn, the upfront cost the customer pays).
- Develop robotaxis that take full advantage of the fact that EVs generate economic value by being run more.
- Develop recurring revenue, currently through services, charging, software subscriptions, notably full self-driving (FSD) software, and in the future, profit sharing from robotaxi rides. Robotaxi revenue came from dedicated Cybercabs (whose value is enhanced by FSD) or existing Teslas transformed via, as yet unreleased, unsupervised FSD software.
First honest opinion of Tesla
All of which leads to the first honest opinion of Tesla.
The robotaxi concept is not a ""moonshot"" for the company or the industry; it's an integral part of the future of the automotive and electric vehicle (EV) industry, and Tesla is leading the way.
All of the above is well known in the industry; it's why Ford Motor Company is investing $5 billion in EV development, and why legacy automakers continue to invest billions in loss-making EVs to try and take market share. It's also why automakers like Ford, GM, Volkswagen, and others have previously invested billions in developing autonomous driving software and robotaxis. Additionally, tech companies like Alphabet (Google's Waymo) and Amazon (Zoox) have invested billions in autonomous vehicle ventures.
Second honest opinion of Tesla
While there's a reason why many companies have invested heavily in autonomous driving and robotaxis, there's also a reason why some, like GM, have abandoned robotaxi development and why Ford and Volkswagen pulled the plug on investing in Argo AI, a company developing autonomous vehicles.
It's not easy to do, especially if you are a minor player in the EV market.
Tesla is not a minor player in EVs. In fact, despite declining sales due to rivals effectively subsidizing loss-making vehicles, it still has a dominant market share in the U.S. It has a fleet of cars to gather vast amounts of data to improve FSD, and its robotaxi rollout, which began in 2025, is underway.
Tesla is a speculative growth stock, but it has significant advantages over most growth stocks, including leading market share and a potentially cost-effective robotaxi/unsupervised FSD offering.
While recurring revenue from robotaxis and unsupervised FSD, as well as Cybercab sales (volume production is planned for 2026), are promising, none of these initiatives have come to fruition yet, and significant technological and regulatory hurdles remain to be overcome.
Is Tesla stock a buy?
It's a speculative growth stock, with a valuation to match. There are no guarantees around robotaxis and unsupervised FSD approval, and CEO Elon Musk has a history of being overly optimistic on the matter.
That said, it's where the industry is headed, and where most of the legacy automakers wanted to be. As such, Tesla is a high-risk/high-reward stock, but such stocks deserve a place in a portfolio, just perhaps not as a core holding for most investors."

Jobs Data Comes as Fed Keeps Close Eye on Labor Market after Rate Cut
After Federal Reserve officials earlier this month said unemployment worries led them to make their first interest rate cut this year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' next employment report will likely show the extent of labor market weakness. The economy added 22,000 jobs in August, a weaker showing than in recent months, while unemployment ticked higher.
With unemployment rising, but inflation also remaining above target, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank faces a “challenging” situation in setting interest rates. That challenge is likely to be further addressed by Fed officials who are scheduled to speak this week, including New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack,
Nike Earnings Put Spotlight on Turnaround Efforts
Will Nike’s turnaround continue? Investors may find out the answer to that question after the sneaker maker’s scheduled quarterly earnings report release on Tuesday. Nike (NKE) posted smaller-than-expected drops in profits and sales in its most recent earnings report, coming as CEO Elliott Hill has promoted a plan to reverse the decline of the athletic wear maker.
Deliveries from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA), expected Thursday, could offer a surprise to the upside, some analysts have suggested, anticipating a near-term boost from consumers rushing to take advantage of EV tax credits before they expire at the end of this month. The EV maker's stock has been hot lately.
Cruise line operator Carnival (CCL) will show whether it can keep its recent success going when it reports on Monday. Investors will also be watching Conagra’s report on Wednesday after the Slim Jim maker reported a 4% sales decline in the prior quarter.

Is the Stock Still a Buy?,Buffett and the Berkshire team took an interest in electric vehicles while the sector was still in the early innings.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=29d5a508d0e933f9baf7579e270b9860151697dbb409f3261b36b2782a05c4fa,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/warren-buffett-berkshire-stake-ev-stock-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/warren-buffett-berkshire-stake-ev-stock-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/warren-buffett-berkshire-stake-ev-stock-buy/,fool.com,200,,"Despite decades of proven investing experience, Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.06%) (BRK.B 0.05%) have never been afraid to adapt or invest in new technologies. In 2008, when the electric car maker Tesla (TSLA 1.39%), now one of the largest stocks in the world, was only five years old, one of Berkshire's subsidiaries decided to invest $230 million in the China-based electric vehicle maker BYD (BYDD.F 2.97%) in return for a 10% stake in the company.
Berkshire held that position firmly for about 14 years, making a killing in the process. The stock had risen by close to 2,000 before Berkshire began to sell big chunks of it in August of 2022. Berkshire actually completely dumped BYD earlier this year, although that was only recently confirmed by media outlets. Is the stock still a buy?
A fantastic investment showing signs of fizzling
U.S. investors may not be as familiar with BYD because their vehicles aren't sold in the country, but Buffett and his team scour the markets and the globe for good investments, and they scored a big winner with BYD, which became more and more obvious in recent years.
BYD has managed to develop cheaper EVs than the likes of Tesla, and with more powerful charging capabilities. Earlier this year, BYD released EV charging technology that could charge nearly 250 miles of range in about five minutes. All of this started to show up in the financials in 2024 when BYD, which also makes hybrid vehicles, surpassed Tesla in annual revenue with roughly $107 billion.
In 2024, BYD grabbed 32% of China's EV market, compared to Tesla at about 6.1%. Things got more exciting when BYD announced plans for expansion and said it expected half of its sales to be outside of China by 2030.
However, the company has shown signs of slowing recently. Throughout the year, management has slashed its full-year vehicle delivery outlook multiple times, bringing it down 16% collectively. In its most recent quarter, BYD saw its profits fall by 30% year over year. The culprit appears to be increasing competition and price wars in China, where BYD still conducts most of its sales.
Buffett and his team may have seen this coming. In a 2023 interview with CNBC, Buffett called BYD an ""extraordinary company"" led by an ""extraordinary person"" in CEO Wang Chuanfu, but ""I think that we'll find things to do with the money that I'll feel better about.""
Erste Group Analyst Stephan Lingnau recently downgraded BYD from a Buy to a Hold, amid increasing competition and negative pricing in the EV sector in Europe, which is a market that BYD has high hopes for. Lingnau said in a research note that the average price of BYD vehicles sold in Europe has decreased every quarter over the last two years, and it's unclear when this trend will abate.
Is the stock a buy?
BYD appears to be dealing with more of an industrywide EV issue, with rising competition and declining prices in Europe. Tougher carbon emission policies in the European Union are also forcing automakers to sell more EVs, which requires price reductions. Lower lithium prices are also allowing companies to make cheaper EV vehicles.
Ultimately, I still think BYD has a really strong and competitive product set, but it's tough to fight industry headwinds right now. Trading at roughly 15 times forward earnings, I wouldn't necessarily classify the company as cheap or expensive. Rather, I'm more neutral on the stock. This is one to maybe nibble at or put on your watch list and monitor for improving EV trends in China and Europe."

In years past, they have focused on the growth opportunity in EV sales, which still represent less than 15% of total vehicle sales in the U.S. The current hype, however, has to do with robotaxis. Some experts believe these could ultimately become a $5 trillion to $10 trillion global opportunity.
EV makers like Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) and Lucid Group (LCID -1.23%) are investing heavily in robotaxis. Competitors like Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.17%), meanwhile, simply seem focused on getting new models to market -- at least for now.
Which stock is the best buy right now? You might be surprised by the answer.
3 things to know about robotaxis
After years of anticipation fueled by Elon Musk's repeated promises, Tesla finally launched its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year. Shortly after, Lucid announced that it would be partnering with Uber Technologies on a robotaxi venture.
Uber would own and operate the robotaxis, and Lucid would supply more than 20,000 vehicles over the next six years to power the service. The market responded positively to both announcements, sending shares of Tesla and Lucid higher in the days that followed.
The age of robotaxis is finally upon us. But there are two other things you should know before getting overly excited.
First, scaling up these robotaxi services will take many years. Musk has predicted more than 1 million autonomously driven Teslas will be roaming U.S. streets by the end of next year. But he has not been not a reliable source of predictions regarding self-driving vehicles. In 2015, he forecast Tesla would achieve ""complete autonomy in approximately two years."" Ten years later, the company's robotaxis in Austin still don't have full autonomy.
The robotaxi market could be huge over the long term, but don't expect huge swings in adoption over the next few years. The technology simply isn't there yet. Regulations are also far behind what's needed for a global rollout to occur.
Second, it appears as if robotaxi stocks like Tesla and Lucid already have a premium built into their prices. Despite falling revenue this year, Tesla shares trade at a lofty 15.4 times sales. Lucid, meanwhile, trades at 7.6 times sales.
Compare those valuations to Rivian -- a stock that doesn't yet have a clear robotaxi narrative and trades at just 3.6 times sales -- and it becomes clear that the market may already be assigning meaningful value to Tesla's and Lucid's robotaxi potential.
Rivian looks like the best stock for most investors
Make no mistake: The robotaxi market is very exciting. But this early in the game -- with so many questions surrounding how quick the rollout will be and which companies will ultimately benefit -- I'm not sure stocks like Tesla or Lucid are worth the up-front premium. Instead, I might stick with an EV maker like Rivian that continues to execute on its core strategy, which should begin to pay off by the start of next year.
Rivian is essentially copying Tesla's path to growth. It started by building luxury cars that, while expensive, showcased the company's capabilities and created a reputation of quality among buyers. The company then quickly focused on scaling up to more affordable vehicles.
Today, more than 90% of Tesla's vehicle revenue comes from its two affordable models: the Model 3 and Model Y. Nearly 70% of prospective car buyers plan to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle. So it should come as no surprise that offering models under this price point is a crucial step toward mass growth.
Early next year, Rivian plans to begin production of three new models, all priced under $50,000. Lucid is still years away from reaching this growth catalyst. Tesla, meanwhile, hasn't introduced a new affordable model in more than five years.
Trading at a discounted valuation despite rosy growth prospects for 2026 and 2027, Rivian remains my top growth stock for the year ahead. Tesla and Lucid have promising futures, but their high valuations make shares far less appealing."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-27T17:53:00,How Canada's EV Mandate Could Put Dollars in Tesla's Pocket,"Despite tensions between the two, Canada might need a helping hand from Tesla, and could pay dearly for it.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3d38d56c9a195e8523beac5f831a8a63a95fed70b7827b72381b15816d199ebd,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/how-canadas-ev-mandate-could-put-dollars-in-teslas/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/how-canadas-ev-mandate-could-put-dollars-in-teslas/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/how-canadas-ev-mandate-could-put-dollars-in-teslas/,fool.com,200,,"Maybe you can call Canada and Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) frenemies. The tension between the two entities has existed since Tesla allegedly manipulated Canada's electric vehicle (EV) subsidy program. While Tesla believes it to be a misunderstanding and was later cleared of wrongdoing, it added to the political tension between the two nations, and added to the Canadian resentment toward Tesla CEO Elon Musk for then supporting the Trump administration.
It was a little messy, so it's even more entertaining now that Canada might actually put more dollars in the pockets of Tesla. Here's the situation.
What's going on
Canadian automakers have been raising red flags and could be in for a bumpy ride if Canada's electric vehicle (EV) mandate is enforced as currently described and EV sales don't accelerate. Essentially, Canada's EV sales mandate requires an automaker to ensure a certain percentage of new cars, SUVs, and light-duty trucks sold are zero-emission vehicles including hybrids.
Originally the mandate was supposed to start at 20% in 2026, but now it will begin in 2027 with the caveat that the initial target will be a challenging 27%. The percentage will rise steadily every year until 2035 when all new vehicle sales are intended to be EVs. For context, EV sales in Canada nearly reached 15% of total sales in 2024, but that was when the government was offering consumer rebates up to $5,000.
Once funding ran dry for the rebate in January, sales took a mighty plunge. The most recent data from Statistics Canada shows EV sales generated 7.7% of all new vehicle sales in July -- a far cry from what's going to be required to meet standards on average.
What are Canadian autos to do?
As most investors following the industry know, there's a way to comply with these mandates by purchasing zero-emission credits from companies that have a surplus. Companies such as Tesla that only sell EVs and have no gasoline vehicle sales to offset, can simply sell their credits to needy gasoline-heavy automakers and pocket the money -- it's great business for pure EV makers. Zero-emission credit sales were instrumental during Tesla's early years and still have been a major contributor to its financials.
The good news for Tesla is that Canadian automakers may not have an option other than to begrudgingly purchase from Tesla despite the ruffled feathers between the two entities. According to Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association president Brian Kingston, with 2026 models already being purchased, Tesla would be one -- if not the only -- automaker with a surplus of credits on hand to sell to other companies.
It also gets a little more complicated because as the targets become more challenging there will be more demand and less supply of these credits available, forcing some automakers to buy them ahead of time to be utilized when necessary. According to Kingston, estimates show over $1 billion has already been committed to this and could cost the Canadian industry more than $3 billion by 2030.
What it all means
Zero-emission credits have been a huge business for Tesla, and the company has generated billions and billions of dollars over the years selling them to needy automakers. Unfortunately for Tesla and other EV makers, changing policy in the U.S. has erased the need for these credits in the states.
In fact, Tesla was estimated to generate $3 billion from credit revenue in 2025 alone before the policy change knocked that estimate down by 40%. Tesla's credit revenue is expected to plunge even further next year to $595 million before becoming irrelevant in 2027.
For investors, an extremely valuable Tesla revenue stream is about to dry up, unless Canada's mandate stays as written. While it wouldn't generate near the revenue the U.S. credit situation has, it would still be a welcome development as credit revenue in the U.S. fades rapidly -- and Tesla could sure use a small win right now."

These companies are responsible for designing the high-performance chips and networking hardware powering next-generation data centers at an unprecedented scale.
Operating more quietly in the background, however, is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). While TSMC (as it is also known) is less flashy than its peers in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, the company's supporting role is nonetheless mission-critical.
As the world's largest chip foundry by revenue -- with almost 70% market share -- TSMC is the manufacturer behind many of the AI industry's most advanced processors. Its dominance has left rivals like Intel struggling to catch up, with meaningful market share gains appearing more like a pipe dream than measurable reality.
But in a surprising twist, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a big break for one of those rivals, Samsung Electronics (SSNL.F 9.01%), giving its investors some much-needed optimism. The announcement raises an important question: Will Samsung's latest win usher in a new era of growth and pose a serious challenge to TSMC's supremacy?
Why Samsung's deal with Tesla matters
In late July, Musk announced on X that Tesla had signed a $16.5 billion agreement with Samsung to produce its next-generation inference chip, known as the AI6. Samsung will be manufacturing these chips at a new foundry in Texas, strategically positioning the company closer to Tesla's headquarters and reinforcing its footprint beyond South Korea.
Tesla's upcoming innovations -- most notably its Robotaxi platform and Optimus humanoid robot -- will demand highly sophisticated chip designs and huge computing capacity to function. This makes securing advanced foundry services essential for the company's ambitions in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.
How does Samsung's relationship with Tesla impact TSMC?
At first glance, a deal of this magnitude might look like a major setback for TSMC. The reality, however, is more nuanced.
Musk clarified that TSMC will manufacture the predecessor chip to the AI6 -- aptly called the AI5. In other words, Tesla is deliberately engaging with multiple foundry partners as a strategic, cautious hedge aimed at reducing supply chain risk and ensuring redundancy.
While Samsung's win provides a boost of credibility to its lagging foundry business, analysts at Morgan Stanley said that the deal is unlikely to meaningfully dent TSMC's dominance or serve as a material headwind to its long-term revenue and earnings potential.
Moreover, as TSMC continues to invest in its own infrastructure here in the U.S., the company remains on secure footing to deepen its ties with AI's biggest spenders even further.
Has Samsung delivered a checkmate against its fiercest rival?
Samsung investors have gained tangible proof that strengthens the company's long-term prospects, but TSMC's durable technological position remains supported by entrenched scale, advanced processor leadership, and deep customer relationships. For now, this deal underscores that Samsung can still compete for landmark contracts and carve out relevance in an industry where TSMC's gold-standard reputation remains firmly intact.
At a more macro level, the deal also signals that as AI applications become increasingly more sophisticated, leading enterprises like Tesla are keen on maintaining choice by diversifying key manufacturing partners to ensure stability, flexibility, and supply chain resilience.
For investors, the larger takeaway is clear: Samsung's relationship with Tesla illustrates that the company is capable of winning meaningful battles. Nevertheless, TSMC is still ahead.
Rather than a checkmate, this development looks more like a fleeting stalemate at best -- a dynamic that will continue to evolve as global demand for next-generation chip architectures accelerates and further intensifies the foundry race."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-27T07:21:00,Tesla's Annual Deliveries Could Soar Past 2 Million Next Year,A new wave of product and capacity catalysts sets up the electric vehicle leader for a volume rebound in 2026.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=96790da63726324ab36974a597c433433d609e69579829b8143430a7494421b7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/teslas-annual-deliveries-could-soar-past-2-million/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/teslas-annual-deliveries-could-soar-past-2-million/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/teslas-annual-deliveries-could-soar-past-2-million/,fool.com,200,,"After a sluggish start to 2025, Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) shares have rebounded sharply this month as investors refocus on what comes next. The electric vehicle maker and energy storage provider has leaned into autonomy, broadened its charging footprint, and (importantly) started building a cheaper vehicle. Those steps come as the company works through a challenging economic environment, stiffer competition, and its own efforts to revitalize its aging lineup.
Against that backdrop, the core question for investors is whether the company can translate its expanding factory base and new models into meaningfully higher volume. With installed capacity already above the 2 million mark and fresh catalysts on deck, Tesla's annual deliveries could push well beyond 2 million in 2026.
Capacity is in place
The math on 2 million starts with capacity. In its second-quarter update, Tesla listed installed annual capacity of more than 550,000 units in California for Model 3 and Y and up to 100,000 units of Model S and X, over 950,000 for Model 3 and Y in Shanghai, and more than 375,000 for Model Y in Berlin. Further, in Texas, it has a capacity of 250,000 for Model Y and 125,000 for Cybertruck. While installed capacity is not the same as current production rate, that footprint collectively supports output well above 2 million vehicles when utilization improves.
Recent delivery data shows why utilization is the lever. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla delivered over 336,000 vehicles following production line changeovers for the refreshed Model Y. And in the second quarter, deliveries improved to more than 384,000. The step up from the first to the second quarter, alongside a broader factory refresh, suggest a pathway back to higher run rates as new configurations stabilize.
Product catalysts are arriving
But, with the help of new products, there's more production growth on the way. Management recently said the first builds of a more affordable model occurred in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025. Tesla also launched an initial robotaxi service in Austin (with a safety rider), while continuing work on Semi and Cybercab for volume production in 2026. These milestones matter because they expand the addressable market and can increase factory utilization by helping to bolster demand for additional units.
Even at roughly 85% utilization of the company's current installed capacity (about 2.35 million units), deliveries would clear 2 million. That outcome also assumes steady throughput in Shanghai (Tesla's export hub) and a continued ramp-up in Texas and Berlin as refreshed Model Y variants and the lower-priced vehicle scale.
However, with a more affordable model on the way and its self-driving technology continually improving, demand could jump.
Still, investors can't ignore the challenging context the company is operating in. Tesla's global deliveries declined year over year in 2024 to about 1.79 million, marking the electric car maker's first annual drop in unit sales in more than a decade. This highlighted how pricing, incentives, and competition (particularly from Chinese automakers) are risk factors Tesla investors need to consider. Additionally, the company's shares command an extraordinarily high valuation. Tesla's market capitalization sits at about $1.4 trillion. This is against trailing-12-month revenue and profit of about $93 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. Any missteps, therefore, could cause a sharp sell-off in the growth stock.
The pieces for a delivery rebound are lining up: an installed capacity base above 2 million, the first builds of a cheaper model with volume slated to ramp up, and a broader push in autonomy and energy that can pull more buyers into the ecosystem. The hurdle, however, is execution. Even in the face of high interest rates, Tesla will need to show investors it can grow demand without aggressive discounting, keep factory lines running efficiently, and navigate intensifying global competition. If the company executes well, deliveries could easily surpass 2 million next year, setting a stronger foundation for margins to recover and helping generate cash to fuel Tesla's ambitious growth initiatives."

Brooks, who co-founded iRobot and spent decades at MIT, is particularly skeptical of companies like Tesla and the high-profile AI robotics company Figure trying to teach robots dexterity by showing them videos of humans doing tasks. In a new essay, he calls this approach “pure fantasy thinking.”
The problem? Human hands are incredibly sophisticated, packed with about 17,000 specialized touch receptors that no robot comes close to matching. While machine learning transformed speech recognition and image processing, those breakthroughs built on decades of existing technology for capturing the right data. “We don’t have such a tradition for touch data,” Brooks points out.
Then there’s safety. Full-sized walking humanoid robots pump massive amounts of energy into staying upright. When they fall, they’re dangerous. Physics means a robot twice the size of today’s models would pack eight times the harmful energy.
Brooks predicts that in 15 years, successful “humanoid” robots will actually have wheels, multiple arms, and specialized sensors and abandon the human form. Meanwhile, he’s thoroughly convinced that today’s billions are funding expensive training experiments that will never scale to mass production.
It’s far from the first time Brooks has poured cold water on expectations set by brash entrepreneurs and eager investors. Last year, he talked at length with TechCrunch about why the promise of generative AI exceeds its abilities and can even create more work in some cases.
For example, the AI research nonprofit METR said this summer it had recruited 16 highly rated developers from large open-source repositories to measure the impacts of AI tools on real-world software development. It then assigned them nearly 250 real issues to address with the tools and without them, and measured their screens. When the developers used the AI tools, they took 19% longer to complete their tasks. As interestingly, they perceived that the AI had sped them up by 20%.
Brooks has also long argued that AI is not the existential threat that many, including Elon Musk, have posited that it is. TechCrunch talked with Brooks about this back in 2017 at MIT, when the landscape looked very different but not entirely dissimilar to today’s playing field.
At the time, Brooks said he was just starting to see more companies specializing in making data sets for machine learning — a trend that has only continued. Relatedly, he argued why it wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion that Big Tech companies would win in robotics, despite what long ago seemed an unsurmountable lead in the amount of data they control. Yet today’s leading robotics companies have not escaped those companies’ gravitational pull."

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and its CEO, Elon Musk, are entering a pivotal phase as artificial intelligence and robotaxis reshape the company's growth story.
Analysts view Tesla as positioned to dominate the autonomous vehicle market, with the expansion of robotaxis and AI initiatives driving its next growth chapter.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained an Outperform rating on Tesla with a price forecast of $500.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Ives argued that Tesla and Musk have entered one of the most pivotal chapters in the company's history as AI reshapes the auto industry and the long-awaited robotaxi market becomes a reality. The analyst said investors are beginning to look past Tesla's near-term demand challenges and recognize the company's strong position to dominate the autonomous vehicle space.
He expects Tesla's robotaxi network to scale to 30 to 35 U.S. cities within the next year.
Ives termed Musk's newly approved pay package as a key positive for shareholders, noting that it ensures Musk will remain Tesla's CEO until at least 2030. The analyst emphasized that Musk remains Tesla's most valuable asset and the board made the right decision to secure his leadership.
The package grants Musk an additional 423 million shares, increasing his ownership to approximately 25% of the voting power. Ives said this level of control is critical for Musk to continue driving Tesla's strategy.
The analyst described this autonomous chapter as potentially transformative, estimating Tesla's AI and self-driving initiatives could add $1 trillion to the company's valuation in the coming years.

Despite skeptics’ pessimism over Musk's robotaxi ambitions, Ives expressed conviction on Tesla’s mass-scale autonomous growth.
He predicted that under President Trump, federal regulators would fast-track autonomous approvals by reducing the role of individual states.
Ives said Musk's complicated relationship with Trump will ultimately benefit Tesla, as both share the goal of keeping the U.S. ahead of China in AI and autonomy.
Looking ahead, Ives forecasts a bull-case scenario where Tesla's market capitalization could reach $2 trillion by mid-2026. The analyst believes the $1 trillion of AI-driven valuation will begin unlocking over the next 12 to 18 months through broader adoption of Full Self-Driving, deeper integration of autonomous features across Tesla's fleet, and the rollout of the Cybercab robotaxi service in the U.S. He described these initiatives as Tesla's ""golden goose"" for long-term growth."

CarGurus director of economic and market intelligence Kevin Roberts discusses the sales increase and the state of the EV industry.
To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.
Well, August saw the highest sales of electric vehicles this year, up 19.4% from July and since January EV sales are up 61%, but some industry analysts fear those high voltage sales could be short circuited after tax credits for EV buyers expire on September 30th. Join me now is Kevin Roberts, Carguru's Director of Economic and Market Intelligence. Kevin, good to see you as always. Uh maybe start big picture, Kevin, you know, what is the story with tax credits? They've they've boosted sales so much.
Kevin, why are they going away? Explain that for us. And have folks been, you know, have you seen them rushing in ahead of that deadline?
Yeah, so as part of the big beautiful bill, uh the expiration of the tax credits was pulled ahead to September 30th. and once that was announced, we really started to see the momentum start to pick up from consumers looking to get ahead of that tax credit expiration. So that's both on the purchase of vehicles and also it's helping on EV leasing as well. So, uh we've been I I've been calling it a EV crescendo uh as consumers really look to get ahead of uh get their sales in uh before that credit expires.
And Kevin, you know, um we did see Tesla update its website, um saying, you know, order by September 30th. This included even a a countdown clock on the site. Kevin, how are how are some of the other auto makers? Do we know? Do we have line of sight there? How are they trying to kind of build awareness, get people in the door in the showroom?
Well, I mean, I can say from our data, you can see that the sales rate has picked up. and not only that, the amount of, you know, the number of EVs on dealer lots has been declining and the market day supply has dropped quite significantly. Uh from where we were, you know, at the end of June, 108 days supply and now we're under 45 days supply. So, the message is clearly getting out to consumers and they're looking to kind of snap up those EVs before that credit expires.
So now bottom line, Kevin. So, you know, now let's let's look ahead. So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball, what what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin? What what would you expect to see?
So, it's it's unknown. I I've been taking a look at what happened in other markets where tax credits expired. If you look to Europe, you know, you saw double digit declines uh of EV sales afterwards. Uh California is one we've been watching, accounting for about 30% of EV sales last year. and there have been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently it just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit. So a large EV market that we could be seeing uh a drop in sales volume in.
Are there certain EV names, Kevin, EV makers that in your opinion, hey, these guys, they they may be better positioned than others in a sort of a post- tax credit world.
So, normally, I would have assumed that automakers might be looking to plug the gap themselves, but we're in a post- tariff environment and that tariff tax bill they're currently consuming most of themselves right now. So I don't know how much automakers are going to be able to really kind of foot the bill uh as those EV tax credits go away.
And and Kevin, by the way, what what does the the used market for EVs look like? You have line of sight there?
Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit. It's for vehicles under $25,000. So we've been seeing an acceleration in that market as well. Not as much as what we've been seeing in the new vehicle market, but there has been an uptick uh in that used EV market and we've been seeing a lot more used EVs particularly get under that $25,000 threshold. And so it's a small but growing market.
We've been talking here about EV's, but let's kind of like broaden out this discussion a bit. Look at that larger car market, uh Kevin, so gas, hybrid vehicles. I saw a JD Power site is saying, um, they think sales is expected to actually contract in September. Do you agree with that, Kevin? And if so, is that, what would be the reasons for that? Is that just high higher rates, higher prices, both?
I I mean, we've been seen almost a pull ahead in vehicle sales the past couple months. We saw that at the end of March, early April when the tariffs were first announced, there was a lot of kind of looking to get ahead of those pre-tariff prices. Uh we saw, you know, an acceleration of sales in July and August as well, um as consumers, you know, didn't see prices increase and were looking to get out there as well. So, there is a concern about potential pull ahead of sales volume. Uh but when and where that might strike is a little bit uncertain at this point.
Kevin, you you mentioned tariffs, just want to end here on that. Um, and just your sense of how they factor into this discussion because you have trade agreements, frameworks with the UK, EU, Japan. I mean, they they do provide for this um, the 15% tariffs. Is that in your opinion, Kevin, is that a, is that manageable for the industry?
So, we've already been seeing automakers uh absorb a lot more of the tariff costs than what I initially expected. I think most people were initially expecting. We can see with trade data, the tariff rates are there and the tariffs are taking effect. Uh so the trade deals that are going to be announced will help to kind of bring down that rate. uh and will provide more room for automakers to potentially absorb those tariff costs for a longer period of time than what we might have initially thought when the tariffs were initially brought out in March.

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 3.1% in the afternoon session after Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the company, citing optimism over its artificial intelligence-driven initiatives, robotaxi rollout, and humanoid robotics business.
The stock's gain marked a comeback after a fall in the previous session that was linked to data showing a sales decline in Europe. Analysts at Wedbush and Deutsche Bank showed renewed confidence. Wedbush increased its price target to a Street-high of $600 from $500, stating that Tesla was advancing its path toward an ""AI Revolution.""
Deutsche Bank also lifted its price target to $435 from $345 ahead of the company's third-quarter delivery report. Both firms kept their ""Buy"" ratings. The positive sentiment was further supported by more recent sales data, which showed a strong rebound. For instance, new Model Y registrations in Sweden saw a significant increase compared to the previous month, and the company posted its strongest European registration week of the third quarter.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $438.17, up 3.5% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped 3.1% as reports surfaced of another month of declining sales in Europe, where the company was outsold by a key competitor.
Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed Tesla sold 8,220 cars in the European Union in August, a drop of about 37% from the same month a year prior. For the year-to-date, Tesla's sales in the region had fallen 43%. In sharp contrast, Chinese competitor BYD sold 9,130 vehicles in August, a 201% increase, marking the second consecutive month it surpassed Tesla's sales in Europe.
Tesla is up 15.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $438.17 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,121.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla urged the Trump administration not to repeal vehicle emissions standards or the long-standing U.S. finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health.
Tesla said in comments posted on Thursday that the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to repeal the standards ""would give a pass to engine and vehicle manufacturers for all measurement, control, and reporting of GHG emissions for any highway engine and vehicle.""
Earlier this week, a group representing General Motors Toyota, Volkswagen and nearly all other major automakers, asked the EPA to roll back its aggressive vehicle emissions limits that seek to force the industry to build a rising number of electric vehicles.
Tesla stands to lose billions of dollars in regulatory credits sold over the coming years as a result of the Trump administration's dismantling of green vehicle rules.
Last year, Tesla said it received $2.8 billion in global revenue from earning regulatory credits for selling zero-emission EVs, and from selling those credits to other automakers seeking to meet vehicle emissions targets.
Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio said at a hearing in July that the costs automakers paid Tesla to be in compliance were ""outrageous.""
The EPA’s proposed action ""undermines the stability of this program, diminishes the value of performance-based incentives that electric vehicle manufacturers accrue under the standards, and creates an uneven playing field - reducing the inducement for investment in vehicle innovation,"" Tesla said.
In 2019, Tesla began spending $25 per vehicle to generate credits by using environmentally friendly air conditioning.
""This investment ultimately amounted to tens of millions of dollars when scaled over millions of vehicles produced for North America since this time,"" Tesla said.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a close adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, before they had a public feud earlier this year. Trump suggested Musk's objection to a major budget bill was because it eliminated consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, which will end on September 30.
In July, the administration told automakers they face no fines for failing to meet fuel efficiency rules dating back to the 2022 model year.
Trump in June signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035.

Sep 26 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained 1.5% in early Friday trading after Wedbush Securities boosted its price target on the stock to $600. The firm kept its Outperform rating, pointing to what it sees as a faster path toward artificial intelligence developments within the company.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said investors still overlook the scale of transformation taking place at Tesla. He highlighted the company's push into autonomy and robotics as central to its strategy heading into 2026, calling it a defining step for Tesla's future.
According to Ives, the AI and autonomous market could bring Tesla an opportunity worth at least $1 trillion. He added that under a Trump White House, regulatory approval for full self-driving and autonomy could speed up, reducing delays that Tesla faced in recent years.
In a bull-case outlook, Wedbush sees Tesla's valuation reaching $2 trillion by early 2026, with potential to hit $3 trillion by the end of that year as production of autonomous and robotics programs scales.
Investors will next watch Tesla's third-quarter delivery numbers in early October, followed by its quarterly earnings report later in the month."

- Big-picture optimism regarding Elon Musk's commitment, AI and robotaxis has helped pull shares of Tesla higher this month. That also has several Wall Street analysts playing catch-up with their price targets.
- Some investors, however, may return their attention to the company's EV business next week, when third-quarter deliveries figures are expected to land.
Wall Street analysts have largely been behind as Tesla's stock has raced higher. They're starting to catch up.
The EV maker's shares have been hot lately, rising about 32% this month alone through Friday's close around $440. (They added 4% in Friday's session; read Investopedia's full coverage of today's action here.) The Street's mean price target, however, is substantially lower, according to Visible Alpha data, recently hanging out around $340—a level the stock hasn't closed below since early this month.
The analyst average, however, got a bump today. Wedbush lifted its price target to $600 from $500. ""An accelerated AI path for the company is now on the horizon and investors are underestimating the transformation underway at the company,"" its analysts wrote. CEO Elon Musk, they said, ""is now driving Tesla into its next stage of growth.""
Why This Matters to Tesla Investors
Shares of Tesla have added nearly a third of their value in September, with the bull case largely shifting from sales of electric vehicles to Elon Musk's compensation package, robotaxis and AI. That may mean investors are less focused on the quarterly vehicle deliveries figures expected next month, a precursor to Tesla's earnings report. Those numbers, however, can still drive moves in and sentiment about the shares.
Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, lifted its price target to $435 from $345 while maintaining a bullish rating. Some of the bank's reasoning was based on optimism regarding third-quarter deliveries figures, which are expected next week: Deutsche Bank expects the company to report a number north of 461,000, higher than the Visible Alpha analysts' average.
But more of their outlook also goes further than vehicle sales, echoing themes Tesla bulls at Wedbush and elsewhere have voiced in recent weeks regarding the company's burgeoning business lines and a financial commitment to (and from) CEO Elon Musk. Other analysts have also recently lifted their targets—among them those at Baird, who on Sept. 19 set a $548 target.
""We think Elon Musk’s clear focus on Tesla’s most important efforts (robotaxi and Optimus) and the recent compensation package have removed a large overhang on the stock and going forward, will allow Tesla to benefit from being a leader in embodied AI,"" Deutsche Bank wrote.

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) received a price target increase from Deutsche Bank on Friday, with the firm pointing to the electric vehicle maker's artificial intelligence initiatives as a key growth driver.
The bank said Tesla's AI-related projects could strengthen its competitive position and create new revenue streams beyond its core vehicle business. While details of the new target were not disclosed in the report summary, Deutsche Bank noted that advances in autonomous driving and AI-enabled software may play a larger role in Tesla's valuation.
The call reflects a broader theme among analysts, with several firms highlighting artificial intelligence as a central factor for stock performance. Morgan Stanley this week reiterated Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) as a top pick on the same grounds, citing expanding demand for enterprise AI solutions.
Investors will next look to Tesla's third-quarter earnings in October for updates on deliveries, margins, and progress in AI-related initiatives."

In 2024, following a mid-flight door blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight, Boeing's production of the 737 Max was limited to 38 planes per month.

Wording in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that killed the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set a hard Sept. 30 deadline for claiming the tax credit, but the IRS is giving buyers and automakers a break by allowing a “written binding contract” for the purchase of the vehicle to qualify for the credit in lieu of delivery of that vehicle by Sept. 30.
Over the weekend, automakers like GM (GM), Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA), and Rivian (RIVN) tried to entice Americans to go electric. Tesla even updated its website to say “order by September 30” and included a countdown clock on the site.
However, despite the ongoing coverage of the tax credit's expiration by traditional media and social sites, it appears that a significant percentage of Americans don’t understand how the credits work.
“While most shoppers have heard of the credit, a recent study from Cars.com shows only about a third really understand how it works,” Cars.com Detroit bureau chief Aaron Bragman said to Yahoo Finance.
“That’s important, because nearly 80% of car shoppers considering EVs say it factors into their decision to go electric, and almost half say they might speed up their plans before the deadline hits,” he added.

Once that’s out of the way, there are price restrictions. For vehicles like coupes and sedans, the MSRP limit to get the tax credit is $55,000. For trucks and SUVs, the limit is $80,000.
Then, buyer income must be limited to $300,000 in adjusted gross income for joint filers or $150,000 for individual filers to qualify.
Finally, there is the lease exemption. Under the law, leasing EVs falls under the commercial EV credit of the law (known as the 45W credit for commercial clean vehicles), which doesn’t require North American assembly or income requirements.
Basically, the rule says any taxpayer (and automaker) leasing a clean vehicle to customers is eligible to claim the commercial EV credit, meaning every foreign automaker from Kia (000270.KS) to Mercedes (MBGAF) qualifies, as well as very expensive EVs from any automaker."

There’s no one who wants to go contrary to this stock and say, look this whole move into, you can’t buy for self driving, it’s too far, and you know you don’t want to buy it for robots.

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-26T12:30:00,Is NIO Emerging as a Better Investment Option Than TSLA Stock?,"NIO's surging deliveries, battery swap edge, and improving margins set it apart as Tesla grapples with sales declines and policy headwinds.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f40fa7989f8b31af318356cf87b898e1ae4b4300a6bffcc37aa980270d37ac8,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-emerging-better-investment-option-123000055.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-emerging-better-investment-option-123000055.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-emerging-better-investment-option-123000055.html,yahoo.com,200,,"For years, Tesla TSLA has been the face of the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. With a roughly $1.4 trillion market cap and ambitions stretching into AI, robotaxis and robotics, it’s still an industry giant. Yet the path ahead is less smooth than before. Rising competition, political shifts, and repeated delays have eroded Tesla’s dominance.
Meanwhile, NIO Inc. NIO, often called the “Tesla of China,” is charting its own path. Its market cap is a fraction of Tesla’s at around $15 billion, and it remains unprofitable. But NIO is firmly rooted in China, the world’s biggest EV market, and is showing signs of fresh momentum.
Tesla is aiming to become a tech powerhouse. NIO, on the other hand, is doubling down on EVs in a supportive domestic market. Let’s weigh the strengths and risks of each to see which stock looks more compelling now.
The Case for NIO
NIO offers a broad lineup of sedans and SUVs, including the ES6, EC6, ET5, ET7 and ET9, alongside its new ES8 SUV. Beyond the flagship brand, its ONVO mass-market models like the L60 and L90 have gained traction, while its Firefly sub-brand adds volume at the lower end.
In the last quarter, deliveries rose 25.6% to 72,056 units, helped by ONVO demand. Management guided for 87,000–91,000 deliveries in the third quarter, up 41-47% year over year. The fourth quarter will see the first full quarter of ES8 and L90 sales, with NIO targeting 50,000 units each across NIO, ONVO and Firefly.
Margins are set to improve, with the L90 and ES8 designed for around 20% gross margin, backed by in-house innovation and cost control. NIO’s battery swap network is another differentiator. It has deployed more than 3,500 power swap stations worldwide, including 1,000+ on China’s highways, with over 84 million swaps completed. Additionally, NIO's lighter and more efficient battery packs reduce weight and cost while matching rivals' range, thereby boosting customer interest in its latest models.
Recently, NIO raised $1.16 billion via an equity offering to fund R&D, expand infrastructure and strengthen its balance sheet. While dilution is a concern, the move provides capital to support its long-term strategy.
The Case for TSLA
Tesla is facing challenges that even loyal fans can’t ignore. After its first-ever annual delivery decline in 2024, volumes kept sliding in 2025 — down 13% and 13.4% in the first and second quarters of 2025, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. A dated lineup, stronger rivals and weaker pricing power are all weighing on demand.
Financial results show the strain. The second quarter marked Tesla’s sharpest revenue drop in more than a decade, and margins are under pressure. Musk himself cautioned about “rough quarters ahead.”"

Tesla Inc. (TSLA, Financials) is being sued for $51 million by a factory worker who says a company robot seriously injured him on the job. The case lands as Tesla is putting more public attention on its robotics plans, including a humanoid robot it hopes to bring into factories and homes.
Peter Hinterdobler, the worker, says that the disaster happened in 2023 when he was taking apart one of Tesla's robots. The claim says that the arm of the machine swung without notice and impacted him with the same power as an 8,000-pound counterweight.. Hinterdobler says he has already faced more than $1 million in medical costs and expects another $6 million in treatment.
He's asking for damages that also cover pain, emotional distress, lost wages, and his reduced ability to work in the future.
The timing is sensitive for Tesla.The business has been advertising its Optimus humanoid robot by showing off prototypes that it believes might ultimately do repetitive manufacturing duties and even chores around the house. The lawsuit brings attention to whether Tesla can keep workers safe while moving faster into automation.
Tesla's stock fell more than 3% Thursday after the lawsuit came to light. Wall Street analysts remain cautious, with most rating the stock a Hold. Even after strong gains this year, the average price target points to little room for further upside.
The company's legal response and whether questions about robot safety spread could shape the next chapter of Tesla's robotics strategy."

So far, that approach is working. Lee, who broadcasts to more than half a million followers on X and is the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, has seen his Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (ticker GRNY) pull in roughly $2.5 billion in less than 12 months. Ives’s eponymous Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES), meanwhile, has shot to around $750 million in assets since its June debut. Both funds are handily beating the S&P 500 Index this year, with GRNY up 23% and IVES 25%.
“I wanted a way for investors around the world, retail and institutional, to invest in the AI theme,” said Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities known for bold calls and a colorful wardrobe. In a world of ultra-complicated ETFs, he said he wanted a fund simple enough “that someone in junior high school could understand what we’re doing.”
Going all-in has its pitfalls. Valuations in tech stocks have grown stretched, leaving concentrated bets vulnerable to a pullback. Investors in hot ETFs can also be fickle, quick to pile in when markets are surging and just as ready to abandon ship if the tide turns. Cathie Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) serves as an example: the fund tumbled nearly 70% when investors abandoned bets on pandemic-era darlings in 2022 and is still seeing outflows, despite a 44% rally this year.
And of course, both Lee and Ives have stumbled in the past. In February, Lee urged investors to buy a tariff-fueled dip in stocks that turned out to be the prelude to a far worse selloff, a call for which he publicly apologized months later. Ives, a long-time Tesla bull, has wavered on the EV-maker. He cut his target on Tesla nearly in half in April, just before the stock began to rebound from its lows of the year, only to reverse course later and declare that the company has entered a “golden age.”"

Wedbush maintains an Outperform rating on the stock, arguing that Tesla is “taking major steps in advancing its AI Revolution path with autonomous and robotics front and center heading into 2026 that will be a game changer and define Tesla’s future.”
The firm highlighted Chief Executive Elon Musk’s push as a “wartime CEO,” forecasting that Robotaxis will be “rolled out aggressively to over 30 U.S. cities within the next year.”
Analysts estimated the AI and autonomous opportunity is “worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla.”
Wedbush expects federal policy shifts to accelerate the rollout, noting: “We fully expect under a Trump White House over the coming year these key initiatives will now get fast tracked as the federal regulatory spiderweb that Musk & Co. have encountered over the past few years around FSD/autonomous clears significantly under Trump.”
On valuation, Wedbush said Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap in early 2026 in a bull case scenario and as much as $3 trillion by year-end as autonomous and robotics scale.
“The AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,” the analysts wrote.
Wedbush also sees near-term delivery strength, citing stabilizing global demand and improvement in China that could help Tesla exceed third-quarter expectations.

It's been a remarkable turnaround after the market sold off in March over worries around tariffs and how that might slow the economy. But recent earnings reports from large tech firms make it clear that the artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity is substantial.
The following companies are changing the world with their technology. If you have extra cash to invest, these are excellent stocks to profit from the AI boom.
1. Nvidia
It's appropriate to list Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) as the first stock to consider, since it makes the chips that make AI possible. The most powerful computers and data centers use Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Its data center segment makes up the bulk of its business, which grew 56% year over year in the most recent quarter.
Nvidia will continue to sell more chips. More advanced AI workloads simply require more computational power. Nvidia should remain the dominant supplier because it continues to maintain a breakneck pace of innovation. This makes it very difficult for competitors to jump ahead, and that's why Nvidia has led the GPU market for the past few decades.
For investors who have any doubt about Nvidia's competitive position, all they need to do is look at the recent $100 billion deal Nvidia just made with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. This is the largest AI infrastructure project in history, which will enable OpenAI to accelerate its AI development to make even better models over time.
""There's no partner but Nvidia that can do this at this kind of scale, at this kind of speed,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.
Nvidia also offers computing systems for training AI for physical products, including robots and autonomous vehicles. These are massive industries in the making, potentially stretching into the trillions of dollars in the coming decades.
2. Tesla
Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) stock has been volatile in recent years, but it has quietly risen about 250% since the end of 2022. The stock is starting to move higher as investors turn their attention to Tesla's autonomous future. It has spent billions in research and development for the past several years, preparing to scale its robotaxi fleet and eventually its Optimus robot, which promises to be an enormously valuable product.
While Tesla has been late to the party in the ridesharing market, its vision-based AI approach involving cameras will allow it to ramp very rapidly, and at lower costs, than competing services that are using more expensive LiDAR self-driving technology. Tesla can already produce close to 2 million cars per year at a profit, which is a major advantage.
Tesla's low cost structure is already allowing it to charge competitively low prices for its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and this advantage will widen once the CyberCab comes next year. Every detail of CyberCab has been designed to lower costs, including using robots to clean the inside of the car between rides.
Ark Invest's Cathie Wood believes Tesla stock will be worth $2,600 by 2029, which is based on the projected profit margin from the robotaxi service. However, CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly said over the past few years that its Optimus humanoid robot will be the company's most valuable product over time. Musk has set a target of making 1 million Optimus robots by 2030.
Musk recently acquired $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, with all the purchases made at share prices between $372 and $396. There are many reasons insiders sell shares, but there's only one reason they buy.
3. Palantir Technologies
Nvidia and Tesla have the bases covered on chips and physical AI. Palantir (PLTR -0.11%) is by far the best software play in the AI market. It provides a deep layer of knowledge for a company to understand its operations better and make decisions about how to grow revenue and maximize profits.
Palantir uses an ontology-based approach, where it brings together multiple data sources that lead to decisive action. It provides deep intelligence, speed, and precision in a highly secure environment, which is why the U.S. government trusts Palantir with sensitive military data.
Many investors are hesitant to buy the stock because of its high valuation, but there are intangible aspects to Palantir's competitive advantage that valuation metrics can't measure. The deep level of trust that the government has in Palantir's ability to handle sensitive information is not easy to replicate. Palantir is also helping companies save millions in costs. A platform that is bringing this much value to organizations is not easy to value, especially since there are a lot of companies that haven't used Palantir yet. Management sees total revenue further accelerating in the second half of the year, with full-year revenue expected to grow 44% over 2024.
Once a company uses Palantir, it becomes deeply embedded in its operations. A company that is seeing tangible results from using the platform is not going to give it up that easily. And of course, Palantir's success will fuel more investment in its AI platforms to deliver even more value to customers over the long term.
Even as Palantir creates tremendous value for companies, it is also creating value for shareholders. The company's free cash flow has risen 765% over the last three years to $1.7 billion, making this a very profitable business already. Palantir has the potential to join the ""Magnificent Seven"" as one of the most valuable companies in the world over the long term."

- Elon Musk’s xAI has sued OpenAI, alleging it induced former employees to steal source code and data center deployment strategies.
- The AI company alleges OpenAI targeted employees with knowledge of its ""secret sauce"" data center operations, with one executive refusing to sign confidentiality documents after leaving for OpenAI.
- One engineer allegedly admitted in a ""handwritten confession"" to misappropriating code after encrypted communications with an OpenAI recruiter.
Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday against OpenAI, accusing its rival of orchestrating a ""coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign"" to steal proprietary technology through targeted employee poaching.
The complaint, filed in California, alleges OpenAI ""by hook or by crook"" induced former xAI employees to misappropriate the company's entire source code, training methods, and data center deployment strategies.
Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI alongside Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Illya Sutskever, and others in 2015, stepped down from the board in 2018, citing conflicts of interest with his company, Tesla, and its self-driving cars. Since then, the tech billionaire has assumed a combative stance against OpenAI, including filing a separate lawsuit last month.
OpenAI recruiter Tifa Chen simultaneously targeted multiple xAI employees, offering multi-million dollar packages to engineers who then stole source code and uploaded it to personal devices within hours of their communications, the lawsuit alleges.
Xuechen Li, an early xAI engineer, allegedly ""uploaded the entire xAI source code base to a personal cloud account"" in July 2025, and later ""admitted in a handwritten confession"" that he misappropriated xAI's code and presentation materials on training techniques.
The lawsuit details timestamps showing Li's code theft occurred within hours of encrypted Signal messages with Chen, who allegedly responded ""no way!"" after Li copied the files, before OpenAI extended its multi-million dollar offer.
Jimmy Fraiture, another early xAI engineer, allegedly ""used the AirDrop feature to transfer"" confidential source code “at least five times"" after signing with OpenAI, stealing ""the majority of xAI's code"" he oversaw, plus experimental folders from four co-founders.
An unnamed senior finance executive who left for OpenAI allegedly called these operations xAI's ""secret sauce,"" saying, ""The data center team. Their speed and precision blew me away. I would NEVER want to compete against them.""
The executive then took a lesser role at OpenAI, focused on data center spending strategy even though he had no prior AI experience, and when confronted about confidentiality obligations, allegedly ""responded with crude sexual expletives"" and refused to sign termination documents.
Navodaya Singh Rajpurohit, legal partner at Coinque Consulting, told Decrypt the case “leans heavily on employee poaching,” noting that whether it crosses from aggressive recruiting to unlawful misappropriation “will depend on evidence not included in the filing,” and that “hiring alone is rarely enough to prove trade-secret misuse.”
Ishita Sharma, managing partner at Fathom Legal, told Decrypt that xAI must define its “secret sauce” broadly, grouping GPU racking, vendor contracts, pricing curves, and orchestration playbooks, which, she noted, can be described “by the results they deliver — like faster deployment or cheaper scaling, without putting the exact technical diagrams or formulas on the record.”
Sharma said “the recruiter angle is trickier,” since liability depends on whether recruiters acted as agents of OpenAI with the company’s knowledge.
For OpenAI’s defense, she explained, the strongest approach would be to show independent creation through “time-stamped records: internal Git commits, R&D notes, supplier invoices, and emails,” with earlier documentation providing the most credibility.
xAI seeks damages, restitution, and injunctions requiring OpenAI to purge xAI material from its systems and even destroy models built with it.
The lawsuit adds to Musk's ongoing legal battle with OpenAI, as last month, his companies filed an antitrust suit against Apple and OpenAI, claiming their exclusive iPhone integration creates unfair market dominance."

That was when Rivian (RIVN 2.17%) came public, to much fanfare. Fast forward a few years to the current day, and Rivian's stock price has fallen some 90% from its all-time highs. Is this a diamond in the rough that could turn you into a millionaire in a Tesla-style success story, or should you have more modest expectations?
Rivian has done big things
To give credit where credit is due, Rivian has achieved a huge amount of success in a very short period of time. It basically went from an idea -- making electric vehicles (EVs) -- to an operating business with a well-respected EV truck and an EV delivery van used widely by retail powerhouse Amazon (AMZN -0.45%). That isn't something that could have been achieved if Rivian didn't have its act together.
Notably, in late 2024, Rivian hit a key milestone, achieving a modest gross profit for the first time. While a gross profit only means that it was able to generate more revenue from selling its vehicles than it cost to produce them, that is a key step toward positive earnings.
The modest gross profit came after Rivian hit another important goal, scaled production. It delivered more than 10,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2025, which is a substantial number. It also has a new truck called the R2 coming out next year, which will be geared to the mass market. That should help to further increase volume, which will allow Rivian to spread its costs over even more vehicles.
In many ways, Rivian is following in Tesla's footsteps. Given the massive stock price advance Tesla has made over its history, some investors might see Rivian as a second chance to catch a little of the Tesla opportunity they might have missed. Don't get overly excited.
Rivian has a long way to go
With a well-respected product and key partners like tech giant Amazon and automaker Volkswagen (which has agreed to provide fresh capital to Rivian based on Rivian's ability to meet certain business goals), Rivian seems like it will establish itself as a sustainably profitable business. However, this goal is still likely to be at least a few years away, given the need to invest in the business and research and development right now. Rivian could help you reach a seven-figure net worth, but it isn't likely to do so quickly.
Moreover, the competition set today is much larger than it was when Tesla entered the auto market. At the time, Tesla was basically the only company making EVs. Today, there are a number of sizable EV makers. Virtually all of the traditional automakers are in the space, too. Even if Rivian is successful, it could still just produce a modest profit at the bottom of its income statement, thanks to the changed competitive landscape.
That said, even that outcome would require strong execution. Although Rivian has lived up to its goals, for the most part, so far, there's no guarantee that it will continue to do so in the future. If the company starts missing its targets, investors are likely to turn deeply negative on the stock.
How much more negative could they get after a 90% price decline? Well, the stock happens to be up nearly 23% over the past year, which is notably better than the nearly 17% gain of the S&P 500 index (^GSPC 0.40%). Even after a 90%+ decline, there's still ample room for a deep drawdown, as investors appear to have priced in a lot of good news in recent days.
Risk takers may find it attractive
It probably wouldn't be a great idea to bet your house on Rivian. But it has achieved a great deal in a short period of time, with material opportunity for more success in the future. The problem is that it could also fall short of its goals and flame out, like many upstart EV makers have already done. If you see the execution strength and want to add Rivian to a diversified portfolio, it could help you reach millionaire status. Just go in recognizing the risk, which is material, and the time period you need to consider, which is long.
That's why more conservative investors will probably want to sit on the sidelines for now. It makes a great deal of sense to wait at least until the R2 has been brought to market, so investors can assess how well the new car does with consumers."

The potential change in Momenta's listing venue comes after the expiration in June of an approval by China's securities regulator to list in the U.S., which was granted mid-last year, according to the regulator's website.
Momenta is a leading Chinese supplier of advanced driving assisted system features, akin to Tesla's self-driving technology that can navigate urban traffic under human drivers' supervision.
The company recently informed some of its investors about its plan to potentially list in Hong Kong in 2026, two of the people said, adding the plan, which has not been reported previously, is at an early stage and is subject to changes.
Momenta, backed by investors such as Toyota Motor and auto parts supplier Bosch, is considering a change in listing venue as it nears completion of a pre-IPO fundraising round, said two of the people.
One of them said the round is expected to involve investors, including Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai.
Details of the IPO, such as the timeline, offering size and valuation are yet to be finalised, the people said.
All the sources declined to be identified as the plan is not public yet.
Momenta said it has not made any final decision regarding IPO plans, including the listing venue.
""Any suggestion that Momenta has informed investors of a confirmed plan to list in Hong Kong in 2026 is untrue,"" the company said, adding it has not announced or confirmed any pre-IPO fundraising round or its participants.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX), the city's exchange operator, declined to comment on individual companies.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) did not respond to Reuters request for comment on Momenta's potential shift of the listing venue.
Mercedes-Benz didn't respond to a query for comment. Hyundai said there is ""a compelling use case"" to collaborate with Momenta in China for its robust autonomous driving tech, without elaboration.
TOP GLOBAL BOURSE
The possible shift in Momenta's listing venue underscores Hong Kong's position as the primary offshore fundraising venue for Chinese companies amid U.S. lawmakers' threat to delist Chinese firms from American exchanges.
Heightened trade tensions between China and the United States have also prompted a growing number of Chinese companies to favor Hong Kong for listings over the past year."

Shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker slid as much as 5.4% in Thursday trading. The stock closed the session lower by 4.3%.
While the company has been focusing more of its message toward artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics opportunities, investors seem to still be concerned about slowing EV sales.
Tesla keeps losing ground
New EV sales data show Tesla continues to lose its lead versus EV competition. August sales data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) showed Tesla sales dropped 37% year over year in the European Union.
At the same time, August was a banner month for Chinese competitor BYD. Its August sales tripled year over year. BYD even outsold Tesla in Europe for the second consecutive month. Year to date, BYD's European sales have soared by 280%, while Tesla's have declined by 33% versus last year.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has tried to focus investor attention on the company's autonomous driving and robotics technologies. But after a 25% increase in Tesla stock over the last month, the continued decline in its EV sales may have some investors taking profits.
So is Tesla a buy?
Owning Tesla shares means expecting volatility. Musk has touted the expansion of Tesla's robotaxi fleet, but that hasn't yet come to fruition. Any future success of that product could drive shares higher. The same can be said of Tesla's robotics aspirations.
But the humanoid robot and a large fleet of self-driving robotaxis aren't yet a reality. Today's stock action shows some investors aren't willing to hold shares with the hope of long-term success of those products."

While markets have seen a recent pullback from records, the optimism for year-on rallies hanging on as the 7,000 level for the S&P 500 is still in reach, but how are derivatives markets digesting the remainder of 2025? Simpler Trading VP of Options Danielle Shay joined us now for a closer look with the Options Playbook, sponsored by Tastytrade.
Danielle, it's good to see you. Um, you know, we know late September, Danielle, uh historically good tends to be a kind of weak period for the stock market, but I am interested what you're seeing in the options markets. How do you want to be positioned here, Danielle?
Well, what we're seeing in the options market is that every single time the market pulls back even slightly, we have buyers coming in. We have retail traders coming in, we have call buyers coming in, and that's why we haven't seen a bigger downwards move. So, as of this time, you know, even though we're getting a little bit of weakness over the course of the past couple days, the put call ratio is spiking right back down as call buyers come in.
Is is it too late to hedge, Danielle? I mean, when you look at the VIX, it's been kind of trending up here.
I don't think that it's too late to hedge. I mean, there's still downside possibility here. If you look at the Nasdaq and the QQQs on the daily chart, we've just had a slight pullback into the 21 EMA. So, you know, typically you can get a deeper pullback into the 34 EMA or the 50 SMA. So, you know, if you wanted to add a hedge on here at those levels, that would be down to about 575 in the QQQ. I think that you can. I just think that overall, if you would have been hedged over the course of the last several months, it it wouldn't have worked out very many times, right? So you have to take that into account.
Let's say Daniel, we do see a year-end rally here. Um, you say if we saw stick with the Mag 7 names and specifically Tesla. Why and what would be the trade there?
So, when you're looking at the Mag 7, you just definitely want to focus on relative strength. And specifically with Tesla, we finally had a big breakout move. We have a pattern on the weekly chart that has finally uh broken out, right? And so for that reason, we're just sitting right below those previous all-time highs. So I'm continuing to trade that momentum to the upside. Obviously, today it's down a little bit, but now that that momentum is here, I'm targeting the return to the previous high and then the $500 strike, which I think is possible if we can continue on with this upward momentum.
What about another here name, uh Roblox? I see that in my notes. What's the trade there, Danielle?
So, when you're looking at Roblox, this is a great relative strength name with a bullish trend. Uh, you know, you could sell put credit spreads in this name because it has pulled back into support and you could also buy long calls on it, buy the stock or buy some bullish butterflies. So if you look at this name, we have about a $30 expected move into the end of the year, so that would bring us up into a new all-time high. Uh, you know, you can retest that previous level. That would be what I call the easy target, and then after that, onwards and upwards into Blue Sky territory.
Uh, any other trades, Danielle, that would be on your radar before I let you go?
Right now, I'm looking at Microsoft and Meta as well. You know, these stocks typically start doing well two to three weeks before earnings starts. So, we're right around that time frame. And I think that as we get into the beginning of October, as earnings becomes more in the news cycle, people are going to look at buying these stocks down at the 50 simple on the daily chart, and I think we're going to see them rallying going into earnings.
All right, Danielle, thank you for your time today. Appreciate it.
Thank you."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped 0.4%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also around 0.5%. Big Tech stocks took hits, with Oracle (ORCL) adding to recent losses and Tesla (TSLA) off over 4%.
Markets are putting the brakes on stocks' recent record-breaking rally amid debate over whether AI fervor is stretching valuations too much.
At the same time, the uplift from the Federal Reserve's switch to lowering rates is fading, as signs of division among policymakers dent hopes for another two cuts this year.
In a positive sign for the labor market, jobless claims data released Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment dropped to 218,000 for the week ending Sept. 20 from 232,000 previously. Continuing claims also fell slightly to 1.92 million.
Meanwhile, US second quarter GDP rose to an annualized pace of 3.8%, rebounding from a 0.6% decline in Q1 and well above estimates for a 3.3% rate of growth.
That sets the stage for Friday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The PCE print for August is expected to show an easing in price pressures, which could make a case for a shift in rate policy.
In corporates, Costco (COST) is expected to report its quarterly results after the bell on Thursday. Investors expect to see a jump in sales as shoppers pursue deals amid economic uncertainty.

Stocks fall for third session in a row as Oracle drops, Fed division casts doubt over future policy
Stocks retreated for a third day in a row on Thursday as Wall Street markets assessed division among Federal Reserve policymakers while better-than-expected economic data put expected rate cuts at risk.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped 0.4% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid around 0.5%. Tech stocks declined as Oracle (ORCL) slid on the heels of an analyst Sell rating.
A better-than-expected GDP print released this morning, along with a drop in jobless claims, made the Federal Reserve's policy decision for next month less predictable.
Investors will examine the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, on Friday.

Intel jumps nearly 10% as chipmaker seeks Apple investment
Intel (INTC) stock was up 10% on Thursday afternoon as investors cheered the chipmaker's attempt to seek investments from iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) in order to work closer together, though Wall Street is wary of such a collaboration.
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said it's unlikely a tie-up (beyond an investment) would materialize anytime soon.
Rasgon said it's ""unlikely"" Apple would collaborate with Intel to co-design a chip for its computers or shift to producing its in-house chips in Intel's factories rather than TSMC's, writing ""a foundry agreement with Intel seems very premature.""
Intel passed on an offer to make chips for Apple's first iPhones in the early 2000s.
Apple moved ahead with its own Arm-based (ARM) chips for personal computers that are manufactured by Intel's contract manufacturing rival, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM).

Tesla stock drops after Europe sales collapse in August
Tesla stock (TSLA) fell 3% after the company's EV sales declined in Europe for the eighth straight month.
Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports that, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell to just 14,831 units in August, a 22.5% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region rose 26.8% in August.
Sales fell sharply in Sweden and Denmark, whereas Norway offered a lone bright spot, with sales up nearly 22%.
Tesla's pains in Europe have grown as stiff competition from Chinese EV makers and the unpopularity of CEO Elon Musk have hurt the brand. A new survey from research firm Escalent found that car buyers in Europe were more likely to consider purchasing a vehicle from China than from the US, with the US's tariffs and trade policies playing a role.
Despite a rough 2025, shares remain positive year to date, though Tesla's 6% gain since the beginning of the year trails the S&P 500's 12% return so far.

Intel needs 'capability' more than money: Analyst
Intel (INTC) is reportedly in talks with Apple (AAPL) to have the iPhone maker invest in the company and for the two companies to work more closely together. But Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said it's unlikely a collaboration (beyond an investment) would materialize anytime soon.
He noted that Apple moved from Intel's chips years ago to make its own Arm-based (ARM) chips for personal computers (PCs) that are manufactured by Intel's contract manufacturing rival, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM).
Intel also famously passed on an offer to make chips for Apple's first iPhones in the early 2000s.
Rasgon said it's ""unlikely"" Apple would collaborate with Intel to co-design a chip for PCs or shift to producing its in-house PC chips in Intel's factories rather than TSMC's, writing ""a foundry agreement with Intel seems very premature.""
Intel designs computing chips and leads the market for CPUs (central processing units) for data centers and PCs, but its market share has eroded in recent years as AMD (AMD) and Arm have gained ground.
Intel has always produced chips for itself, but its internal manufacturing business began to fall behind technologically over the past decade. In 2021, the company opened that business to outside customers, launching Intel Foundry Services, in a bid to breathe new life into its factories.
That hasn't worked so far: Intel Foundry Services' losses ballooned to $13 billion in its 2024 fiscal year from $7 billion in 2023, and those losses helped send Intel's stock plunging 60% last year.
Last week, Nvidia (NVDA) announced it would take a $5 billion stake in Intel, following the US government's $9 billion investment in the struggling company in August.
""Hence what Intel really needs is CAPABILITY, which would allow them to attract customers that would allow them to fill the capacity that the money might help them build,"" Rasgon wrote. ""But their capability issue have nothing to do with money; they will have to figure that out on their own.

Oracle extends losses as Redburn analyst initiates coverage with Sell rating
Oracle (ORCL) shares fell more than 4% Thursday as Alex Haissl, an analyst with investing firm Rothschild & Co Redburn, initiated coverage of the stock with a Sell rating.
Haissl said Oracle’s recent five-year revenue guidance for its cloud business (OCI) that sent the stock soaring is a risk, writing that ""the market is already pricing in a risky blue-sky scenario that is unlikely to materialise,” per Bloomberg. He set a $175 price target on the stock, while shares traded around $297 on Thursday.
The decline in Oracle shares follows a nearly 2% dip from the previous trading session as the software giant sold $18 billion US investment-grade bonds.
Oracle's bond sale came as the rising AI cloud firm rushes to build AI infrastructure for its clients, which range from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and Meta (META) to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT). As of this summer, Oracle was leading a record data center leasing pipeline in the US as tech giants go all in on AI infrastructure, according to TD Cowen analysts.
Earlier this week, Oracle was named as an investor to take part in the US-China TikTok deal, and the company also named two new co-CEOs in an executive leadership shake-up.

IBM stock rises as HSBC touts its quantum computers for forecasting
IBM (IBM) shares rose over 3% Thursday as its customer HSBC (HSBC) said it has improved its ability to predict market behavior when using IBM's quantum computers.
The London-based bank said it has integrated IBM's Quantum Heron — its latest quantum chip — with classical and AI computers.
""By using quantum computers to model the European market at different points in time, and feed better data to its AI workflow, HSBC saw a 34 percent reduction in the errors made by its algorithm,"" a spokesperson for IBM told Yahoo Finance.
HSBC claims this is the first empirical evidence of quantum computers delivering measurable value for a real-world financial services problem.
""This is a ground-breaking world-first in bond trading,"" HSBC 's head of quantum technologies, Philip Intallura, said in a statement. ""It means we now have a tangible example of how today’s quantum computers could solve a real-world business problem at scale.

US stocks fall at the open
US stocks fell at the open on Thursday, extending declines after two consecutive days of losses.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.3%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.6%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.9%.
The declines come as fresh data from the US Department of Labor showed jobless claims unexpectedly falling last week, complicating the narrative of a weakening labor market that has been fueling the case for further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

US economy rebounds in Q2 at 3.8% annualized rate
Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday showed the US economy grew at its fastest pace since 2023 in the second quarter.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.8%, a dramatic rebound from the 0.6% drop in the first quarter and above estimates for 3.3% growth.
The effects of the Trump administration's trade policies have skewed GDP readings somewhat. For instance, the first quarter decline primarily reflected a surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP, the Commerce Department said.

US jobless claims unexpectedly dip
Jobless claims in the US unexpectedly fell to 218,000 in the week that ended Sept. 20 from 232,000 the previous week, according to data from the Department of Labor released Thursday morning.
The 218,000 initial unemployment insurance claims were also lower than the 221,000 claims in the same week last year.
Economists tracked by Bloomberg had expected jobless claims to rise to 233,000 last week amid widening cracks in the labor market. Those cracks have featured heavily in discussions over the Fed's path to interest rate easing, as officials on the central bank's board of governors have expressed dissenting opinions over such rate cuts moving forward.

Shares of CarMax (KMX) fell 12% in premarket after the used-car dealership chain's quarterly results came in significantly short of Wall Street estimates.
The company's CEO, Bill Nash, described the second quarter as ""challenging"" in a statement alongside the second quarter report.
CarMax posted Q2 earnings per share of $0.64, compared with the $1.03 expected by analysts. Revenue also missed the mark, coming in at $6.59 billion versus the $7.05 billion estimated in a Zack's survey and $7.01 billion in the year-ago quarter.

White House amps up shutdown stakes with threats of mass firings
The White House budget office directed federal agencies to devise plans to permanently reduce their workforces if the government shuts down next week, raising the stakes of an outcome that looks increasingly likely by the day.
Politico reports that the White House memo targets ""employees who work for programs that are not legally required to continue.""

Call of the morning: Redburn drops a Sell on Oracle
As a former analyst, I love gutsy calls on stocks. My vibe was often to go against the grain where it made sense. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't — it was fun either way.
I have to give Redburn's Alex Haissl a shout-out this morning for dropping a Sell rating on one of the hottest stocks of the year, Oracle (ORCL). Haissl makes a compelling case to take profits in Oracle, in a new 59-page report shared with me.
Here's his overall thesis:
Haissl slapped Oracle with a $175 price target, assuming 42% downside from current levels.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
All right, now time for some of today's trending tickers. Ya Finance is Ali Canal join me here to take a look at Intel, Tesla, talk a little Starbucks. Let's start with Intel.
Seaport research upgrading that stock to neutral. It's coming amid reports that Intel is in talks with Apple to invest in the company. So this one Ali Seaport uh does go to neutral.
Basically saying they're cautious on the long-term fundamentals but um they say in the near term the stock is likely to be driven. They say by follow on investments and the potential for a stop gap solution for the Fabs. What do you think?
Right. So the near-term catalyst is the focus on for this upgrade. Uh and you know, Intel, it's been in the news a lot recently. We have the Nvidia partnership, Nvidia committing $5 billion dollars, the White House taking a 10% stake in the company. And then you mentioned Josh that report that maybe Apple could invest and there could be a closer collaboration there. Now this is a potential revival of a partnership that Apple moved away from in 2020 when it launched its own chips.
So that in combination is lifting shares of Intel uh today, this afternoon. But for Intel, I just think there's a long road ahead and that upgrade did acknowledge that that over the long term, it's going to be difficult for this company to really catch up to where the others are in this AI race. It's just been behind the eight ball for so long. However, you do have that support now from the government that really wants to bring as much on-shoring as they can to really boost this AI boom.
Yeah, if you saw more direct investments in Intel, I don't know how much that would really be about Intel or is it about also a great way to stay on Trump's good side.
You know, you like Intel, we like Intel. And we've seen billion could be worth it. You know.
Yeah, all these tech executives have been seen at the White House in recent months so.
Yeah, for sure. All right, let's turn two now. Tesla the EV makers seeing uh European sales sliding in August. Our own Prosian has this story for us pointing out uh Tesla here Europe sales drop over 20% in August compared to a year ago, marking the eighth straight month of declining Tesla sales in Europe.
Yeah, that means Tesla's market share is just 1.2% in Europe. That's down from 2% one year ago. And if you compare that to Chinese competitor BYD, they posted a nearly 200% surge in August. So the competition is essentially non-existent. And actually that that might be a 200% surge year to date here. But regardless, Tesla has really struggled in Europe, especially amid these Chinese competitors. Uh shares, I will say, are up around 20% over the past month. This comes after Elon Musk pledged to buy $1 billion worth of stock back.
Year to date though, we are still only up around 5% and it's certainly been a big laggard compared to those other Mag 7 names. And you know, in the US, Tesla did have that first mover advantage. It it it does well in the US. There have been more competition competitors here you could say with some of the big three introducing their own EV models. But Tesla needs to make sure that they can get the car profits right. Because even though over the long term, the Bulls are sort of hanging their hats on robo taxis, uh the promise of autonomous driving. In the interim, this they need to sell cars. And that has to happen both in the US but also especially in Europe and that just seems to be a harder and harder reality for this company to achieve.
Yeah. Now Musk did warn after Q2 earnings that Tesla was in for a said a few rough quarters. And Pros does remind us Tesla will actually give investors the official update of its overall third quarter numbers that's coming next week.
All right, finally, Starbucks announced plans to close unprofitable locations and cut corporate jobs. So, uh this one CEO Brian Nickel making moves, Aly plans to limit 900, these would be non- retail roles, close open positions. This is all part of this $1 billion restructuring effort. We will continue to carefully manage costs and stay focused on the key areas that drive long-term growth, he writes. Uh and this does come after the company already laid off about 1,100 employees.
Yeah, CEO Brian Nickel making moves. He was a former CEO of Chipotle. Now he's at Starbucks and he was specifically brought in to revamp the uh the the really the future of this company that's really just struggled. I mean, underperforming especially with those stores, posting its six straight quarter of falling US same store sales. So, Brian Nickel hoping to reverse that. It's a $1 billion restructuring plan. You mentioned 900 corporate jobs will be eliminated. They're going to reduce the North American footprint by about 1%. And those stores that I mentioned that are underperforming, they'll be shut down as well. And this does bring up a good point to me because even walking around New York City, you see so many Starbucks every single block. And and maybe there is a need to focus on more quality over quantity and that seems to be the playbook of Brian Nickel at this moment in time. Uh they are going to be reinvesting in 1,000 remodels and rolling out a new lower cost prototype store with more seating and drive-through options by 2026. So optionality for the consumer as well.
Yeah, September 9th marking one year for Nickel now at the helm of the company. And he's got his work cut out for him. In his latest quarterly results, Starbucks did post its sixth straight quarterly drop in US Team store sales. That stock is down about 10% from here.
It's been brutal. Brutal, brutal journey for Starbucks.
All right. Thank you Ally. I appreciate it."

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-25T18:54:33,Tesla asks EPA not to roll back emissions rules as Trump calls climate change a ‘con job’,The company's regulatory policy team is trying to clean up a mess that CEO Elon Musk spent $300 million to help create.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2d218ee94148f0332a617fa93b9c7386f09165e7289adde94192fc9f1557aa61,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-asks-epa-not-roll-185433557.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-asks-epa-not-roll-185433557.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-asks-epa-not-roll-185433557.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Tesla has asked the Environmental Protection Agency not to roll back current vehicle emissions standards, breaking from other major automakers who want to see the rules eased. The company’s request comes the same week that President Donald Trump — who Tesla CEO Elon Musk spent $300 million to help elect — told the United Nations General Assembly that he thinks climate change is a “con job” and a “scam.”
Tesla also asked the EPA not to scuttle a 2009 legal standard known as the Endangerment Finding, which many modern environmental regulations (like the vehicle emissions standards) are based on. Tesla said that finding is “based on a robust factual and scientific record,” according to the company’s letter to the agency.
The EPA has been seeking comment since August for these proposed attacks on environmental rules. The agency’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said at the time that, if passed, the rollbacks would drive “a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.”
Tesla’s nominal mission is to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” But the company financially benefits from stricter environmental regulations. When other automakers fall short of fleet emissions goals, they pay companies like Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars to buy “credits” to make up the difference. (Those credits technically come from a California program that has also been a Republican target.) While Tesla is asking for the standards to be maintained, the company told the EPA it is “open to discussing mechanisms to streamline” them in order to keep them around."

On Thursday, Mr Trump’s administration said it had orchestrated a deal to use Mr Musk’s xAI technology across federal departments and pay for almost nothing for it over the next 18 months.
The move marks a thaw in relations between the two men, which had been plunged into the deep freeze after a dispute over Mr Trump’s spending bill.
Mr Musk said: “Thanks to President Trump and his administration, xAI’s frontier AI is now unlocked for every federal agency.
“We look forward to continuing to work with President Trump and his team to rapidly deploy AI throughout the government for the benefit of the country.”
Under the terms of the deal, US government departments will pay a nominal sum of 42 cents to deploy xAI’s Grok models in its system.
The number 42 is a favourite of Mr Musk’s because it appears as the ultimate answer to everything in The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, a novel by Douglas Adams, whom the billionaire calls his “favourite philosopher”.
Although similar deals have been made for Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Lama, xAI’s is the longest to date. The tech firm will also provide engineers to help government workers implement the technology.

It comes just months after a spectacular public row erupted between the two men when Mr Musk said Mr Trump’s “big, beautiful” spending bill was a “disgusting abomination”.
The tech entrepreneur ridiculed the bill for driving up government borrowing – undermining his attempts to cut government spending.
It seemed to mark a dramatic end to an alliance that had involved Mr Musk donating more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Mr Trump’s election campaign and play a central role in mass sackings of government workers.
The spat led Mr Trump to threaten to ban Mr Musk’s companies from government contracts.
Writing on TruthSocial, the president said: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”
However, on Sunday, the pair shook hands at the funeral of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in an exchange Mr Trump called “nice”."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla urged the Trump administration not to repeal vehicle emissions standards or the long-standing U.S. finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health.
Tesla said in comments posted on Thursday that the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to repeal the standards ""would give a pass to engine and vehicle manufacturers for all measurement, control, and reporting of GHG emissions for any highway engine and vehicle.""
Earlier this week, a group representing General Motors Toyota, Volkswagen and nearly all other major automakers, asked the EPA to roll back its aggressive vehicle emissions limits that seek to force the industry to build a rising number of electric vehicles.
Tesla stands to lose billions of dollars in regulatory credits sold over the coming years as a result of the Trump administration's dismantling of green vehicle rules.
Last year, Tesla said it received $2.8 billion in global revenue from earning regulatory credits for selling zero-emission EVs, and from selling those credits to other automakers seeking to meet vehicle emissions targets.
Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio said at a hearing in July that the costs automakers paid Tesla to be in compliance were ""outrageous.""
The EPA’s proposed action ""undermines the stability of this program, diminishes the value of performance-based incentives that electric vehicle manufacturers accrue under the standards, and creates an uneven playing field - reducing the inducement for investment in vehicle innovation,"" Tesla said.
In 2019, Tesla began spending $25 per vehicle to generate credits by using environmentally friendly air conditioning.
""This investment ultimately amounted to tens of millions of dollars when scaled over millions of vehicles produced for North America since this time,"" Tesla said.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk was a close adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, before they had a public feud earlier this year. Trump suggested Musk's objection to a major budget bill was because it eliminated consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, which will end on September 30.
In July, the administration told automakers they face no fines for failing to meet fuel efficiency rules dating back to the 2022 model year.
Trump in June signed a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035.

Per the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell to just 14,831 units in August, a 22.5% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), rose 26.8% in August, with overall registrations regardless of powertrain up 4.7%.
August’s total marks the eighth straight month of declining Tesla sales in Europe. However, August's total was better than the drop seen in July, when sales slid 40.2% year over year to 8,837 units.
Tesla stock closed down over 4% Thursday.
Tesla's sales hangover rolled on in certain key territories in Europe as the introduction of the revamped Model Y wasn't enough to blunt the effect of rising competition and CEO Elon Musk's deep unpopularity.
Earlier this month France’s PFA auto lobby reported Tesla registered only 1,331 vehicles compared to 2,532 a year ago, representing a 47.2% drop. Meanwhile, overall August auto sales in France were up 2.2% in the month.
Tesla sales in Sweden (down 84%) and Denmark (down 42%) tumbled as well, per Mobility Sweden and Mobility Denmark. EV-crazed Norway was a lone bright spot, with sales up nearly 22%. Germany and the UK, Tesla’s two other larger territories, will report August sales later this month.
August’s weakness follows a rough 2025 overall. In the first eight months of the year, Tesla sales dropped 32.6% to 133,857 units, again per the ACEA. Conversely, Tesla’s overall market share in Europe dropped to 1.5% from 2.3% a year ago.

Per the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell to just 14,831 units in August, a 22.5% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), rose 26.8% in August, with overall registrations regardless of powertrain up 4.7%.
August’s total marks the eighth straight month of declining Tesla sales in Europe. However, August's total was better than the drop seen in July, when sales slid 40.2% year over year to 8,837 units.
Tesla stock closed down over 4% Thursday.
Tesla's sales hangover rolled on in certain key territories in Europe as the introduction of the revamped Model Y wasn't enough to blunt the effect of rising competition and CEO Elon Musk's deep unpopularity.
Earlier this month France’s PFA auto lobby reported Tesla registered only 1,331 vehicles compared to 2,532 a year ago, representing a 47.2% drop. Meanwhile, overall August auto sales in France were up 2.2% in the month.
Tesla sales in Sweden (down 84%) and Denmark (down 42%) tumbled as well, per Mobility Sweden and Mobility Denmark. EV-crazed Norway was a lone bright spot, with sales up nearly 22%. Germany and the UK, Tesla’s two other larger territories, will report August sales later this month.
August’s weakness follows a rough 2025 overall. In the first eight months of the year, Tesla sales dropped 32.6% to 133,857 units, again per the ACEA. Conversely, Tesla’s overall market share in Europe dropped to 1.5% from 2.3% a year ago.

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 3.1% in the afternoon session after reports surfaced of another month of declining sales in Europe, where the company was outsold by a key competitor.
Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed Tesla sold 8,220 cars in the European Union in August, a drop of about 37% from the same month a year prior. For the year-to-date, Tesla's sales in the region had fallen 43%.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago when the stock gained 3.9% on the news that it received a wave of positive commentary from Wall Street analysts and upbeat forecasts for third-quarter vehicle deliveries.
Wolfe Research stated that the electric vehicle maker's Q3 deliveries could reach between 465,000 and 470,000 units, topping consensus estimates of 445,000. The firm partly attributed the potential lift in volume to consumers speeding up purchases before a $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired.
Adding to the positive sentiment, Piper Sandler's Alexander Potter raised his price target to $500 from $400, highlighting Tesla's strength in artificial intelligence. Similarly, Baird analyst Ben Kallo upgraded the stock to a “Buy.” One prominent analyst, Dan Ives, forecasted that the company's march to a $2 trillion valuation had begun, driven by opportunities in AI and autonomous Robotaxis.
Tesla is up 12.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $427.83 per share, it is still trading 10.8% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,151.

Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

And now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Tesla, Open Door and Accenture.
First up, we got Tesla. Those shares are slumping as European car sales continue to plunge. Joining us for more, Yahoo Finance's Ali Canal. So, this has obviously been an issue for Tesla for a while and there doesn't seem to be much relief.
Not much relief. If we take a look at the data, sales in the EU tumble 36.6% in August.
Wow.
That means Tesla's market share in Europe is now 1.2%. That's down from 2% last year. So, just continuing to see these sharp declines.
And year to date, Tesla's EU sales are off 43%. And then if you compare that to China's BYD, which saw a 200 plus percent surge in August sales, there really just seems to be no competition here for these Chinese EV makers. Tesla has been losing ground to some of these rivals for quite some time and really hasn't benefited from the revamped Model Y either.
Uh shares are down today. You're seeing off about 4%. Uh though they have rallied a bit over the past month after Elon Musk pledged to buy $1 billion dollars worth of Tesla stock.
Uh but but for for Tesla, Europe just hasn't been the strong suit. In the US, it is pretty much the only option out there. Of course, you have the big three pushing deeper into the
Well, there's a lot, there's a lot of other options now.
Yeah, but but the first mover advantage, I guess I should say.
Right. Yeah.
Tesla has been able to benefit from that and be the leader at least in EVs. And overall for EV adoption in the US, it's not quite at the levels that we thought we would be, especially with the roll back of the EV tax credits and then the infrastructure struggles as well.
Right. Right.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing what you mentioned about the Model Y because Tesla defenders in the sort of depths of the PR crisis for Tesla, they were saying, well, it's just because it's not actually because of political headlines, it's because people are waiting for the Model Y remapp. Uh, how'd that work out?
And now that's not translating.
Yes, exactly.
I'm going to be really curious to see once we start to lap the losses this year, then what next year's uh numbers for Tesla look like.
Yeah, and for the Tesla Bulls out there, they're very focused on robotics. They are into the robo taxi rollout. But cars, EVs, it still makes up the bulk of the the profits for this company. So they need to be able to deliver there, both in the US and Europe.
Sure do. Right.
Right, definitely. All right, let's also talk about open door. Those shares are popping. Jane Street revealing a $61 million stake in Open Door. So those shares are up by about 5% today.
Yeah, nearly a 6% stake from Jane Street. And look, this is a stock that some on Wall Street, like Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager is trying to make the claim that it's not a meme stock, but it certainly operates like one. Year to date we're up over 400%.
Open door shares also saw a nice pop after US new home sales surged over 20% in August. This was the strongest monthly gain in over three years. So open door, uh trying
to revolutionize the real estate industry, utilize AI. So any uh recovery that we can see there for the buying of homes, some activity that's going to be reflected, you would think in shares here. But again, it does very much operate like a meme stock. It is very volatile and and we're continuing to see those up and down movements depending on certain headlines.
Right, exactly. Or on nothing at all sometimes.
Or nothing at all. Yes.
As meme stocks tend to do.
Yeah, exactly.
All right, let's talk about Accenture as well. That company out with earnings that show how government cutbacks are affecting the consulting firm. Accenture, like many large consultancies is pretty reliant on the federal government. And so they sort of quantified the effect that that's having.
Yeah, the cutbacks, we saw the DOJ layoffs continuing and over the September, there was a lot of the expiration of some of those benefits. So I'm curious to see how that's reflected in the jobs numbers that we'll be getting shortly.
But this is that multinational professional services firm specializes in IT and management consulting. Uh they reported $17.6 billion in revenue last quarter topping estimates, but did say that those US federal spending cuts could trim as much as 1.5% off of growth next year.
Uh still the company expects revenue growth between 3 to 6% and plans to return more than $9 billion to shareholders. And the CEO also saying that they're betting big on AI to train the entire workforce on new AI tools. You are seeing shares slip just slightly here down a little bit over 1%. Over the past year they're down around 30%.
So a big struggle there and I think uh you're hearing a lot from the companies that are struggling right now that they're going to be leaning in further to AI and hoping that the reliance on AI or at least integrating that more into their business models can reverse some of the declines or some of the slums that we've been seeing. By execution, I think is going to be key for investors and monetization too. How is AI actually helping your company improve and perform better?
Right.
Well, and in the case of Accenture, their value proposition is they're going to help clients to do that AI AI integration. So it's not just helping internally, it's that's part of the services that they're they're pitching. Exactly.
It's the pitch. Yes.
So, we'll see how that continues to play.
And you and you'd have to think that there are there is a big need here to train folks on AI and how to uh kind of get a new skill set in this current workforce. We've seen uh younger workers especially really struggle right now with AI as a factor there. So it it's definitely important. It's just which companies can rise to the occasion.
Yes. Yes, and capitalize on it. Thanks so much, Ali. Appreciate it.

1 The Distribution Rate shown is as of based of the NAV per share as of September 25, 2025, adjusted for corporate actions. The Distribution Rate is the annual rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution remained the same going forward. The rate represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV adjusted for corporate actions.
2 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents the net investment income (excluding option income) earned by the ETF over the 30-day period ended August 31, 2025. It is expressed as an annualized percentage rate based on the ETF’s share price at the end of that period. This metric does not reflect the total income generated by the fund, as it excludes option premium income central to the YieldBOOST strategy.
3 Each GraniteShares YieldBOOST ETF seeks to generate income by selling put options on the underlying asset. While this strategy can generate attractive premiums, it generally caps the upside potential of the ETF. If the reference asset appreciates significantly, the ETF will not fully participate in those gains. However, if the reference asset declines in value, the ETF may experience losses that are not offset by the income received. Investors may be exposed to downside risk while forgoing upside participation."

- A former Tesla employee is suing the company and robot maker Fanuc for $51 million after an industrial robotic arm allegedly threw him to the floor and knocked him unconscious while working on equipment. The incident took place July 22, 2023, at Tesla’s Fremont, California, facility.
- Robotics technician Peter Hinterdobler was helping a Tesla engineer disassemble a Fanuc industrial robot, when the robot’s arm “suddenly and without warning” struck the technician with the force of “an approximately 8,000-pound counterbalance weight,” according to a complaint filed in the Northern District Court of California on Sept. 19
- Hinterdobler allegedly suffered physical, emotional and financial harm, including approximately $1 million in medical expenses to date, according to court documents. He is seeking recompense for Tesla and robot maker Fanuc’s alleged negligence.
Dive Insight:
U.S. manufacturers are increasingly adding robots to their assembly and production lines in an effort to improve worker safety and productivity, in part by by making the robots perform dangerous or risky tasks traditionally done by humans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, this trend has also brought new risks to the workplace, including electrical hazards and unexpected worker injuries.
Researchers identified 77 robot-related incidents from 2015 to 2022 that resulted in 93 injuries, according to a 2024 report, citing U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration data. The injuries included finger amputations, as well as fractures to the head, torso, legs and feet.
At the time of the incident, the industrial robot had been relocated to a different area of Tesla’s Fremont, California, facility that was “not designated for such equipment,” according to the complaint. The workers were also allegedly “interacting with the robot in a reasonably foreseeable manner.”
“While the engineer attempted to remove the motor at the base of the robot in order to access its internal dress pack, the robot's arm suddenly and without warning released with great force,” the complaint reads.
Following the incident, Hinterdobler alleged that Tesla implemented new rigging and safety protocols specifically related to the Fanuc robot involved in his injury. He also believes that Tesla has video footage of the incident, but has not been provided access despite multiple requests, according to the complaint. The robotic arm caused Hinterdobler to be “thrown to the floor” and “lose consciousness.” Details of the injury were limited beyond that.
Hinterdobler’s complaint, originally filed July 22 in the Superior Court of the State of California in Alameda County, was moved to the Northern District of California in San Francisco on Sept. 19.
Tesla’s counsel has since sought to dismiss the case, arguing that California’s Worker Compensation Act’s “exclusive remedy provision bar[s] his claims.”
The Fremont location is one of the largest manufacturing facilities in the state, producing Tesla’s Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y vehicles. The plant has previously come under fire for allegedly allowing racial harassment against Black employees. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Tesla over the matter in 2023. The case is ongoing.
Requests seeking comment from Fanuc, Tesla and Hinterdobler’s attorney were not immediately returned."

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Now, H&M shares, they're searching. They're up over 8% now after the Swedish retailer posted a blockbuster third quarter operating profit.
It jumped to 4.91 billion crowns, up from 3.51 billion a year ago, as customers snapped up its autumn collections. That easily beat analyst expectations. CEO Daniel Irver, who took the reigns back in January 2024, has been pushing trendier styles to compete with the likes of Shean and Zara.
But H&M is warning that looming US tariffs will squeeze margins in the current quarter. That headwind is definitely worth watching as the apparel chain shifts some sourcing closer to America.
Now, Tesla is in the spotlight as we just got some fresh European sales data. While the stock is almost stable this morning, down about half of a percent and still hovering around 2025 highs, Chinese rival BYD, well, it overtook Tesla for the second straight month. While Tesla's sales slumped more than 36%, BYD sold three times as many new cars in the European Union last month, as it did a year earlier.
Tesla's market share, wait for it, is now 1.2% in Europe. Investors remain focused on whether the EV pioneer can make strides in robotics, AI, and other areas Elon Musk is prioritizing.
Now, on to Opendoor, which has really been trying not to look like a meme stock, but certainly does look like one.
The real estate platform keeps seeing big swings. Its shares closed Wednesday up more than 16% and and adding another seven, well, 6.3% pre-market. The catalyst this time seems to be a filing showing that Jane Street Group has taken a 5.9% stake, about 44 million shares, signaling institutional confidence.
Positive housing data also helped. US new home sales in August jumped 20.5% month over month. The news is keeping retail traders confident in Opendoor, which is up nearly 1,400% in the past three months. While analysts caution that the stock is still highly speculative as well.
Now, another stock you need to know about, Hertz Global. The car rental company is popping in early trade, up now about 5% in pre-market after it announced I it's now down 1% in pre-market. Now, it announced plans to expand its se- sell senior notes and is looking to clean up its balance sheet.
That plus earlier news this year that activist Bill Ackman's Pershing Square owns a 20% and a recent partnership with Amazon Auto has bulls optimistic even though Hurt still carries a heavy debt load."

They're missing the bigger prize. The real money lies in robots that do things: picking packages, welding parts, moving inventory. Goldman Sachs just tripled its humanoid robot forecast to $38 billion by 2035, while industrial robotics could climb to a whopping $94 billion. And thanks to AI foundation models, robots are suddenly 10 times cheaper to train.
Look at Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) warehouses. More than a million robots already work alongside people to move billions of packages. That's not science fiction, it's happening today. Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) is scaling humanoid production from hundreds toward thousands. Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) supplies the Isaac platform that powers both companies, along with nearly every other serious robotics program. Together, these three tech giants give investors distinct paths into the $130 billion robotics wave that's only just starting to break.
Tesla's $20,000 gamble
Tesla claims Optimus could one day represent 80% of its future value. That sounds extreme, but CEO Elon Musk has a track record of turning audacious ideas into reality -- often years later than promised. In 2025, the company managed only a few hundred units, far short of its 5,000-robot goal, and leadership turnover has raised questions about execution.
The bet comes down to cost. Tesla is targeting $20,000 to $30,000 per humanoid, while rivals like Figure and Boston Dynamics price well above $100,000. If Tesla can hit that price point, humanoids move from rare capital expenditures to scalable operating expenses. Even its diner deployment, which looked like a publicity stunt, generated real-world data that no lab simulation can match.
Tesla's advantage is vertical integration. The same neural networks guiding cars can guide robots, its electric vehicle (EV) batteries can power humanoids, and its factories already scale in volumes that competitors can't touch. Shares are up about 5.5% this year, and at 166 times forward earnings, the stock assumes near-perfect execution. Still, if Optimus delivers even a fraction of its promise, the upside could dwarf today's core automotive business.
Amazon's million-robot advantage
Amazon doesn't chase hype. It quietly runs the world's largest robotic fleet -- more than 1 million units already deployed across its fulfillment network. These aren't prototypes, but production systems that move millions of packages every day.
With the rollout of DeepFleet, Amazon says it improved travel efficiency by about 10%, a modest gain that compounds massively at a global scale. Its Hercules robots lift 1,250 pounds, while Proteus units navigate safely among human workers, blending heavy-duty capability with human-friendly design.
The advantage isn't just volume but integration. Next-generation facilities now operate an order of magnitude more robots than older sites, yet they also employ more skilled technicians in maintenance and reliability.
Amazon's model proves automation shifts work rather than erases it, while driving throughput and lowering unit costs. Competitors show off demos; Amazon embeds robotics into daily operations. That discipline creates a durable edge -- and an earnings flywheel few rivals can replicate.
Nvidia's robotics platform lead
Nvidia doesn't build robots -- it builds the software and chips that make them work. The tech giant's Isaac GR00T foundation model trains humanoids, Isaac Lab and Sim provide the simulation environment, and Jetson Thor brings high-end inference to the edge. This stack is quickly becoming the default toolkit for robotics teams from Boston Dynamics to Agility, even as some companies layer in their own custom systems.
The playbook mirrors Nvidia's CUDA dominance in AI training: Create indispensable software and let hardware demand follow. By selling the brains, tools, and pipelines, Nvidia captures value no matter which robot design wins. At roughly 50 times earnings, the stock already assumes excellence, but if robotics adoption scales toward the trillion-dollar forecasts, a platform-style take rate on physical AI could still leave plenty of upside."

Much of this momentum can be traced to a small basket of companies. Relentless demand for AI vaulted Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing into the trillion-dollar club. Established giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla have each enjoyed a new wave of investor enthusiasm.
Yet with valuations stretched to historic levels, some investors may worry that the AI trade is drifting toward bubble territory. A new report from consultant firm McKinsey & Company, however, offers a different perspective: a $7 trillion clue that could reshape how skeptics view the future of AI.
Data center capacity is just getting started
According to McKinsey's forecast, global data center capacity is set to nearly triple by 2030 -- climbing from 82 gigawatts today to 219 gigawatts at the start of the next decade.
Crucially, roughly 70% of this growth will be driven by AI workloads, while the remainder will be tied to traditional cloud and information technology (IT) applications.
In total, McKinsey projects that capital expenditures to fund this infrastructure expansion could approach $7 trillion over the next five years.
Why do these trends matter for AI valuations?
During the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco traded at peak price-to-sales (P/S) multiples between 30 and 40. Today, skeptics contend that some AI leaders are exhibiting similar signs of excess -- with some trading at elevated P/S and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios relative to historic norms. Tesla and Palantir Technologies, in particular, stand out with valuations that may be stretched to unsustainable levels.
But the comparison to the dot-com era overlooks some critical differences. At the height of internet euphoria, many technology darlings had minimal sales traction, persistent cash burn, and valuations built on metrics such as clicks and user growth.
By contrast, AI already enjoys enterprise-grade adoption across industries ranging from cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research to autonomous systems, retail, and robotics.
What's more, McKinsey's data indicates that companies can count on continued cash flow as data center spending continues.
Put simply, as AI infrastructure continues to increase rapidly, the revenue and profits generated by companies powering this accelerated transformation are likely to translate into sustained premium valuations over time.
$7 trillion of opportunity suggests long-term upside
History's prior bubbles were primarily supported by hope, which can be fleeting. However, continuous spending on chips, servers, networking gear, and efficient energy systems is converging on the next generation of products and services that can be measured and benchmarked against financial growth.
Far from signaling a bubble, the upcoming $7 trillion investment marks the first wave of an infrastructure supercycle reshaping entire economies. In other words, this is the foundation for the next technology roadmap.
For investors, the takeaway is clear: Volatility is inevitable, but structural demand from AI is locked in. Semiconductor designers and manufacturers, cloud hyperscalers, and energy innovators sit at the center of this demand -- positioned to capture powerful secular tailwinds over the coming years.
Viewed in this context, today's investments represent early entries into a historic growth narrative that continues to expand. For long-term investors, megacap AI stocks remain some of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the modern AI infrastructure boom."

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has secured a patent that will reportedly be used in the production of the Elon Musk-led EV giant's upcoming Cybercab.
Tesla's Unboxed Process
The patent — part of the automaker's unboxed process, which involves the company assembling different components of the vehicle separately before putting them all together during final assembly — uses a robotic station for holding each car part, influencer Sawyer Merritt wrote as he quoted a post on X on Tuesday. ""This is partly how the Cybercab will be built,"" Merrit shared.
""The parts are locked in place with vacuum clamps, then glue is applied to either the part or the car frame,"" Merritt said while describing the process, adding that the robot lines up the components using reference points.
Tesla's Robotics Push, Musk's Compensation Award
The news comes as the EV giant has shifted its focus towards Robotics with the Optimus line of humanoid robots illustrated by the company's Master Plan IV and by Musk's comments predicting that the robot would present over 80% of Tesla's future value.
Tesla has also urged shareholders to vote in favor of the new compensation award for Musk, which the CEO himself has said would help him retain control over the company so that he can help build ""millions of robots.""
Meanwhile, Tesla's sales have been lackluster across multiple markets in the world, with the company's U.S. market share declining to below 40% for the first time since October 2017. Tesla's European sales are also down in double-digit percentages.
The automaker also recently discontinued the most affordable RWD Long-Range version of the Cybertruck in the U.S., which retailed for $69,990 and offered trimmed-down specs and towing capacity. The company was also reportedly sitting on over 10,000 unsold units of the Cybertruck.

But CEO Elon Musk isn’t one of those investors.

Trending Now: 6 Big Shakeups Coming to Social Security in 2025
Musk recently purchased roughly $1 billion worth of Tesla shares in what was viewed as a vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker, the BBC reported. The share purchase upped Musk’s stake in Tesla to more than 15%, according to estimates from TipRanks, making him now far and away the biggest individual shareholder in the company.
If Musk shared his Tesla holdings with everyone in the United States, you’d probably see plenty of smiling faces. Of course, in terms of the financial benefit, it would be about enough to pay your utility bills for a month.
Here’s a look at how much money every American would get if Musk distributed all of his wealth in Tesla shares equally.
Musk’s Tesla Holdings
According to TipRanks, Musk owned about 506.8 million shares of Tesla stock as of Sept. 19, 2025 (506,794,076 to be exact). That represented a 15.71% stake in the company.
Tesla’s stock price closed at $426.07 per share on Sept. 19. Based on that price and Musk’s holdings, his stock position in Tesla is worth about $216 billion – roughly 45% of his overall net worth of $480.2 billion, according to the latest Forbes estimate.
Here’s a good indicator of how rich Musk is: If he gave away all of his Tesla stock and distributed it to every American, he’d still be worth about $216 billion. That’s enough to rank him as the fifth wealthiest person in the world.

How Much Would You Get If Musk Gave Away His Stock?
If Musk wanted to give away all of his Tesla stock and distribute it evenly to every American, he’d need to divide his holdings by 341.2 million people. That was the estimated U.S. population in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures cited by Trading Economics.
Here’s the math:
-
Musk’s Tesla stock value: $216 billion
-
That value divided by the U.S. population: $216 billion/341.2 million
-
How much money each American would get: $633.06
As the above calculation shows, you’d get about $633 from Musk if he decided to divide his Tesla stock holdings equally among every American.
So what could you do with that money? One thing is pay your next round of utility bills — and have enough left over to celebrate with dinner out.
The average U.S. household spends about $590 on utility bills every month, according to research from This Old House. That total includes electricity, gas, water/sewer, waste/recycling, internet/cable and phone."

Electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) could have some good news when it comes to past months of falling demand in regions in Europe.
Here's the latest.
What Happened: In 2025, the company faced weaker demand in European countries, which could be due to a number of factors like pricing, the public view of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and increased competition.
After months of declines in the first half of 2025, things are looking up for the Musk-led company in Europe.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Registrations for vehicles were 5,500 units for the week of Sept. 15 through Sept. 21, according to Teslarati, citing social media data.
This marked a 25.3% week-over-week increase in registrations for Tesla vehicles in the tracked countries and marked the best week of the third quarter.
According to the latest report, Tesla's sales in the tracked European countries are up 6.3% quarter-over-quarter, with one week remaining. Year-to-date, Tesla sales are down around 20% in the region.
The countries tracked by X user Piloly are the United Kingdom, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Czech Republic and Iceland. These 10 countries collectively account for around 60% of the European EV market.

Why It's Important: While Tesla's sales in the European countries are down year-to-date, the rebound in the third quarter could be a positive sign and help the company finish the year strong.
Overall global second-quarter deliveries for Tesla totaled 384,000 and were down 14% year-over-year. This marked the second straight quarterly decline for Tesla deliveries on a year-over-year basis.
The European news comes as Deutsche Bank predicts Tesla will sell 72,000 units in China in September. That represents a 27% increase over the previous month.
While September may be too late for true second-quarter momentum, Tesla could be surging at the right time and post a stronger-than-expected third-quarter figure for deliveries, potentially setting the stage for a better-than-expected fourth quarter as well.

The electric-vehicle (EV) maker sells mass-market cars like the Model 3 and Model Y, plus premium vehicles including the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck. The near-term debate is whether third-quarter deliveries can top expectations after a softer first half of the year.
There is a credible case for an upside surprise. Financial company UBS recently lifted its estimate for Tesla's third-quarter deliveries, and two near-term tailwinds line up with that call: the approaching deadline for the federal EV tax credit and a well-timed Model Y refresh. Put together, demand may have strengthened enough to help the company return to growth.
A return to growth is possible
UBS is now modeling for about 475,000 deliveries in the third quarter, a figure that exceeds the consensus analyst estimate ahead of the report. And that would be a return to year-over-year growth in the key metric.
UBS argues that U.S. buyers have an extra reason to act before the Sept. 30 cutoff for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, and international demand looks steadier than earlier in the year.
The tax credit timing matters. Tesla's own messaging has emphasized the deadline's significance. That urgency has likely pulled some fourth-quarter demand into September.
Product innovation helps, too. The redesigned Model Y -- a comprehensive update to the company's best-selling vehicle -- began rolling out earlier this year with a quieter cabin, revised exterior lighting, updated interior materials, and a rear passenger display.
The update gives undecided buyers a fresh reason to choose a Model Y right as tax-credit driven traffic picks up. The company also continues to market full self-driving (while supervised) as a subscription add-on, and it has said it is preparing for broader releases, including in new markets, subject to regulatory approvals.
Visibility for these advanced driver-assist features -- along with pilot Robotaxi testing now approved in Arizona -- keep Tesla in the autonomy conversation and help the brand stay in front of shoppers.
Signs of a bottom
Context from the last two quarters clarifies why an upside surprise is plausible. In the second quarter of 2025, Tesla delivered more than 384,000 vehicles, down from about 444,000 in the second quarter of 2024. That year-over-year decline set a cautious tone, but it also was an improvement from the first quarter, when deliveries totaled about 337,000 as the company paused production lines to transition factories to the new Model Y.
So the second quarter represented a sequential step forward, even as the company navigated a challenging comparison against the same period last year.
Heading into the third quarter, the two catalysts above -- deadline-driven purchases and a stronger Model Y lineup -- could be enough to extend that sequential progress. If deliveries land near the mid-470,000s, the narrative about the company's delivery trends could shift positively. That would not solve every concern, but it would reset expectations for the back half of the year.
Still, there are several key risks that investors should consider. If expiring incentives pull demand into the third quarter, fourth-quarter deliveries could underwhelm even if the third quarter looks strong.
Also, competitive pressure remains intense in China and Europe. And while Tesla's self-driving efforts have kept the EV maker in headlines, true autonomy remains subject to regulation and ongoing validation, which means timelines can slip.
Lastly, the stock's valuation (about 250 times earnings) already reflects extreme optimism; even a ""beat"" on deliveries may not translate into lasting share gains if investors worry about the fourth quarter.
A refreshed Model Y landing at the same time as a widely publicized tax-credit deadline is a powerful combination. If that pairing drives deliveries above expectations, it can help investors gain more confidence in a future reinvigoration of the company's key automotive business.
Shares would still be risky, given the growth stock's sky-high valuation. But a return to growth would definitely be a move in the right direction."

Tesla (TSLA)
Electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA) saw another month of declining sales in Europe in August, while Chinese rival BYD (002594.SZ) continued to gain market share in the region, according to data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) on Thursday.
The industry association said that new registrations of Tesla (TSLA) vehicles across Europe fell 22.5% in August to 14,831 units, with its market share shrinking to 1.9% compared to 2.5% at this time last year. Since the start of the year, the ACEA data showed Tesla (TSLA) sales had fallen 32.6%.
Meanwhile, new registrations of BYD (002594.SZ) cars in Europe surged nearly 216% last month to 11,455 units, with its market share rising to 1.4% from 0.5% a year ago.
Overall sales of battery electric cars across Europe rose nearly 27% in August, while registrations for plug-in hybrids and hybrid electric vehicles rose 56% and nearly 12%, respectively.
Tesla (TSLA) shares were little changed in pre-market trading on Thursday morning, while BYD (002594.SZ) closed the trading session in Shenzhen up 1.7%.

(NASDAQ: JZXN), a retailer and franchisor of New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) in China, saw its shares briefly surge 55.5% in premarket trading Wednesday. This happened right after the company announced a $1 billion crypto investment plan.
The strategy focuses on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB. A dedicated risk oversight framework was introduced. The move represents a strategic step to diversify corporate assets amid intense market competition.
SponsoredStrategic Crypto Investment in a Competitive NEV Market
Jiuzi operates at the forefront of China’s NEV sector. It handles vehicles from emerging domestic brands and international entrants. The company is listed on the US Nasdaq, showing its connection to global capital markets. Meanwhile, the Chinese NEV market is the largest in the world but highly competitive. Following the reduction of government subsidies, domestic giants such as BYD and NIO and international players like Tesla are engaged in intense price competition. Companies are seeking alternative growth strategies.
Against this backdrop, Jiuzi’s $1 billion crypto plan is a strategic step. The board-approved plan focuses initially on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. The company emphasized governance and risk management. The size of the allocation drew strong market attention. Shares briefly surged 55.5% in premarket trading.
Risk Oversight and Corporate Governance
Jiuzi established a Crypto Asset Risk Committee led by CFO Gao Huijie. The committee oversees the investment within a defined risk management framework. The company clarified it will not self-custody the digital assets. Any expansion beyond the approved cryptocurrencies requires reassessment and board approval.
CEO Li Tao said, “This initiative represents a proactive step in financial management to protect and enhance long-term shareholder value.” The statement signals a measured approach aimed at sustainable corporate growth rather than short-term speculation.
Dr. Doug Berger, recently appointed Chief Operating Officer, will oversee financial initiatives related to this strategy. Analysts noted the plan evokes parallels with other corporate cryptocurrency strategies, including MicroStrategy and Tesla. Controlled digital asset exposure has provided new avenues for long-term value creation despite crypto volatility.
Market Reaction and Strategic Implications
The brief share surge reflects investor interest in companies combining traditional business operations with strategic crypto exposure. Volatility remains a key consideration. Jiuzi’s structured oversight and transparency measures highlight a cautious approach. The company’s approach may offer insights into how corporate treasury diversification complements growth in China’s NEV market."

Growing Up In A High-Profile Family
Wilson was born to Musk and fantasy novelist Justine Wilson. After their divorce, she attended several schools, including Crossroads in Santa Monica, where she graduated in the same class as actress Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter, Apple Martin. She described the environment as ""exactly what you'd expect of a private high school filled with nepo babies,"" saying she felt like an outsider.
Her relationship with Musk deteriorated after she came out as transgender at 16. In 2022, she petitioned a judge in Los Angeles County Superior Court to change her name and gender, writing in the filing, ""I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.""
Public Rift And Media Attention
The rift became public when Musk commented on her transition in interviews. In an interview with psychologist Jordan Peterson in July 2024, Musk said his daughter had been ""killed by the woke mind virus.""

Wilson responded on a Threads post later that month writing: ""Last time I checked I am, indeed, not dead."" She later told NBC News that her father was ""quick to anger,"" ""uncaring,"" and ""narcissistic.""
Author Walter Isaacson, in his 2023 biography of Musk, detailed how the strained relationship shaped some of the billionaire's public stances. Meanwhile, Wilson told New York magazine she gets a lot of hate in her direct messages, including ""disgusting, unhinged things"" about her body.
Choosing Independence And New Goals
Despite the scrutiny, Wilson has taken steps to distance herself from her father's reputation. According to New York magazine, she enrolled in colleges in Quebec and Tokyo, pursuing language studies before returning to Los Angeles."

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by about 0.4%, The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.3%. The declines marked a reversal from the indexes' earlier gains.
Debate over the prospects for US interest rate cuts — the big focus for markets right now — appeared to pressure stocks. Comments from Federal Reserve officials this week have hinted at growing disagreement on what the path of policy should be, given cracks showing in the labor market.

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-24T17:40:47,Why Is Tesla (TSLA) Stock Rising Today?,Tesla Stock Rises As Musk Defends $1 Trillion Pay Plan,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6cb356067a19a63c15bfec9e3960e3c377c667ee60d8bf609298d06bd53a643a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-stock-rising-174047187.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-stock-rising-174047187.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-stock-rising-174047187.html,yahoo.com,200,,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.
Sep 23 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares moved up more than 3% on Wednesday after CEO Elon Musk publicly defended his proposed $1 trillion compensation package. Musk framed the plan not as a payout but as a way to ensure he maintains enough influence over Tesla's growing focus on artificial intelligence and robotics.
Musk explained on X that the proposal, which could award him 425 million additional shares, about 12% of Tesla's current float, is tied to long-term safety and governance as the company expands into robotaxis and humanoid robots.
Supporters argue the plan helps lock Musk's leadership into Tesla's next chapter, where AI and robotics demand careful oversight and heavy investment. Critics worry the share dilution could weigh on earnings per share in the short run.
The board pitched the package earlier this month as critical to keeping Musk focused on Tesla's physical AI vision. Investors now wait for more details on regulatory milestones, robotaxi pilots, and earnings reports that could shape how the market views both the compensation package and Tesla's future growth path."

In its Chinese Automotive Brands Impact study, research firm Escalent found several trends in European car buyers' decision-making. The study found that 47% of buyers would consider a vehicle from China, whereas only 44% would consider an option from a US automaker. In 2024, those figures were flipped, with 31% considering Chinese vehicles and 51% considering American.
The study polled 1,692 respondents from May 21 to July 31 of this year.
""Although the study wasn't intended to assess why consideration was changing over time outside of Chinese brands, I believe that geopolitics (tariffs, trade deals, the US stance on Russia/Ukraine) is playing into European buyers' sentiment about the US and US auto brands,"" Escalent vice president of powertrain innovation KC Boyce said to Yahoo Finance.
Boyce noted that consideration of automotive brands from other countries also increased year over year, with the US being the lone exception.
In addition, general levels of trust in goods from various countries stayed the same or increased for every country except the US, Boyce said.
For instance, the level of trust for goods from Japan increased to 54% from 50%, South Korean goods to 34% from 30%, and Chinese goods to 19% from 12%.
The US? Trust levels fell to 24% from 31%.
Price also plays a part in the equation. Buyers in Europe have widely held expectations that Chinese vehicles will be cheaper, even if they're objectively superior, Boyce said, adding, ""I think this certainly plays into issues of affordability.""
An interesting difference between European and US car buyers, for example, is that a substantial portion of European buyers still consider EVs, which helps the Chinese brands, as they offer many EVs in the EU.

""While I wouldn't say the data points to a strongly or widely held belief, it does appear that European buyers tend to think of Chinese BEVs as being more trustworthy purchases,"" Boyce said.
Recent sales data reflects this trend. Sales reports from certain EU countries show that Tesla (TSLA), easily the biggest US EV maker, is still seeing demand issues,
Per the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations — a proxy for sales — in Europe fell to just 8,837 units in July, a 40.2% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), rose 33.6% in July, with overall registrations regardless of powertrain up 5.9%."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-24T13:00:03,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know","Zacks.com users have recently been watching Tesla (TSLA) quite a bit.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.
Shares of this electric car maker have returned +21.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has gained 21.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.7%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $1.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.4%. This estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 indicates a change of +49.3% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)."

For one, the cost of charging up EVs is often significantly less than what you’d pay fueling up an ICE car at a gas station.
This fueling difference is particularly noticeable when comparing Teslas, which tend to be highly efficient, versus a big ICE vehicle, like a Chevorlet Silverado pickup truck.

Granted, the comparisons are not apples to apples, since most Teslas are much smaller than Chevy Silverados, although the Tesla Cybertruck is closer in size. Still, Teslas get much better miles per gallon (MPG) equivalent, even when comparing the Cybertruck versus electric versions of the Chevy Silverado, according to federal data.
So, if you’re thinking about switching from a relatively inefficient car like an ICE Silverado to a Tesla, here’s what the fuel savings might look like.
Cost Breakdown of Charging a Tesla vs. Chevy Silverado
Given that Teslas have better fuel economy than all versions of the Chevy Silverado, the more miles you drive, the starker the cost savings would be. But even if you drive an average amount — about 1,123 miles per month, according to Federal Highway Administration data — you’d still save a lot driving a Tesla usually.
Also, note that the vast majority of EV charging takes place at home, according to the International Energy Agency. While costs might be higher if you’re charging at public stations often, here’s what the average Tesla charging costs look like based on average residential electricity rates across the country, according to data from Tesla and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
| Model | Approximate Monthly Fueling Cost |
| Tesla Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive, | $49 |
| Tesla Model Y Long Range All-Wheel Drive | $54 |
| Tesla Model S Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive | $54 |
| Tesla Model X Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive | $64 |
In comparison, the most-efficient ICE version of a 2025 Silverado gets about 26 MPG. That means driving the U.S. average amount of miles per month requires about 43 gallons of gas. h uses nearly 47 gallons based on that 24 mpg average, and note that other Explorer models get even less per gallon.

So, based on the national average gas price of $3.192 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, that means it costs over $137 per month to fuel up a Chevy Silverado."

To receive the full compensation package, Musk must stay at Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) for at least 7.5 years, and 10 years to earn the whole amount. He must also satisfy operational objectives, such as directing the commercial deployment of one million autonomous taxis along with one million robots.
Cantor Fitzgerald sees the compensation package as the board’s tactic to keep Musk concentrated on spearheading Tesla’s shift from electric vehicles to robots and AI.
Based in Austin, Texas, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a well-known clean energy company that is best known for its electric vehicles (EVs). In addition to designing, producing, and marketing EVs, Tesla also offers solar panels, solar shingles, and energy storage devices.

The stock has been on a tear, leaving many investors excited but also a little wary of what comes next. Just this past week, Samsung shares jumped 9.0%, capping off a remarkable 19.2% gain in the last month. Year-to-date, the returns have been stunning, up 59.6%. In fact, looking back over the last three years, shares have climbed more than 70%. That kind of performance certainly grabs attention, but it also makes the question of value even more pressing.
Behind the scenes, big stories have been at play. For example, news broke that Tesla picked Samsung’s foundry division to build its next-generation AI chips, a headline that has further boosted confidence in Samsung’s long-term growth prospects. Meanwhile, the company's ability to settle a sizable $279 million patent dispute quickly, and navigate U.S.-China chip supply debates, has kept risk in check and boosted sentiment. But while these headlines help drive daily moves, the bigger question is whether the stock’s current price really offers value, or if it has already run too far.
To help answer that, it is helpful to know that Samsung currently boasts a valuation score of 5 out of 6 possible checkmarks for being undervalued, based on key financial metrics. That is an encouraging omen for value-seekers, but of course, no single score can capture the full story. Next, we will dig into which valuation methods support the bullish case for Samsung, and, if you stick around, why there may be an even smarter way to judge if the stock is worth your money.
Approach 1: Samsung Electronics Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a common way investors estimate the real worth of a company by projecting its future cash flows and then “discounting” them back to today’s value. Simply put, it asks: what are all the future cash profits from this business really worth in today’s money?
For Samsung Electronics, the current Free Cash Flow stands at approximately ₩16.2 trillion, or about ₩16,200 Billion. Analysts expect strong growth ahead, forecasting that by 2027, the company’s annual Free Cash Flow could reach ₩35.6 trillion (₩35,600 Billion). Looking even further out with extrapolations, the ten-year projection approaches ₩62 trillion (₩62,000 Billion). These robust figures paint a picture of a company with healthy earnings power over the next decade, especially given ongoing demand for advanced chips and technology platforms."

“Q3 is poised to be a strong quarter,” Wolfe wrote, pointing to stronger-than-expected demand in both the U.S. and China.
The firm estimates deliveries of 465,000 to 470,000 vehicles, up 22 percent quarter on quarter and 1 percent year on year, “well ahead of Consensus / WRe of 445k.”
Part of the upside stems from U.S. buyers rushing to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, while China also contributed.
“We estimate 165-170k deliveries in Q3, or ~10k above our prior est,” Wolfe said, adding that volumes “largely do not reflect the recent launch of the Model Y L.”
With stronger volumes, global pricing trends, and contributions from Tesla’s energy business, Wolfe sees third-quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.55 to $0.60, compared with the consensus of $0.49.
The firm expects auto gross margins, excluding credits, of about 16.5 to 17.0 percent.
Looking ahead, Wolfe cautioned that “Q4 will be more challenging,” with a step-down in revenue and earnings as U.S. demand is pulled forward by tax incentives.
It has factored in a 30,000 unit quarter-on-quarter headwind.
Still, Wolfe pointed to several offsets: “seasonally stronger demand in Q4, especially in China & Europe,” new model launches including the Model Y L and Tesla’s upcoming affordable lineup, rising energy storage deployments, and progress in autonomy.
The firm noted Tesla is “poised to enter several new US markets (including AZ, NV, and FL), increase their Austin fleet size, and roll-out FSD v14.”

That market cap roughly translates to a stock price of around $627 given the company's current shares. That's 44% higher than the stock's price at market close on Sept. 22.
Given Tesla's potential over the next 15 months, should you be loading up on Tesla stock? I'd say only if you're extremely bullish on Tesla's new business segment, and there's reason not to be overly excited.
Robotaxis could be a $1 trillion opportunity for Tesla
What makes Ives so bullish on Tesla stock? After years of heavy investment to advance self-driving capabilities, Tesla launched a pilot version of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year. Ives was present for the launch, experiencing the service firsthand. He called the experience ""the future,"" adding that it ""exceeded expectations.""
In terms of near-term growth, Ives is optimistic. ""Tesla is in a pole position to be a clear leader in the autonomous market opportunity with Robotaxis set to scale to 30 to 35 cities in the U.S. over the next year,"" he recently told clients. ""We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,"" he said, adding that ""the march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun.""
Ives isn't alone in his bullishness. Major Tesla shareholder Cathie Wood believes the global robotaxi market could eventually be worth $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk himself has declared that there will be ""millions"" of autonomous Teslas driving on the streets of America by the end of next year. That's an ambitious goal but indicates how enthusiastic Musk is.
Clearly the market believes much of the hype. Tesla is expected to see a sales decline this year, yet shares trade at a hefty premium to other electric car stocks.
The global robotaxi market is clearly exciting, and Tesla is arguably in the driver's seat when it comes to taking a leading role in this valuable opportunity. But is the hype worth the upfront premium? There are a few things to keep in mind before jumping in.
Don't blindly trust Tesla's management, other investors, or analysts
Here's the problem with the rosy predictions discussed earlier: All three of these personalities -- Musk, Wood, and Ives -- are known for their overly optimistic takes.
Musk has been promising self-driving cars for nearly a decade, with many failed promises along the way. Even the ""autonomous"" vehicles in the Austin pilot project have had many documented issues, often requiring human overseers to take the wheel remotely.
Wood, meanwhile, has a track record of overestimating Tesla's future stock price. In 2019, for example, she predicted Tesla's stock price would reach $700 to $4,000 per share by 2024. Tesla's peak price that year was around $430.
Ives has proven no more reliable. Earlier this year, he slashed his price target on Tesla stock from $550 per share to just $315, only to raise his price target aggressively within a few months as shares started to rebound.
When you look at alternative estimates for the global robotaxi market -- estimates not generated by Tesla's management team, its investor base, or the most bullish analysts -- you get a much more sober view of how big this market is likely to be over the next five to 10 years. Fortune Business Insights predicts this market to be worth roughly $120 billion by 2031. Precedence Research calls for a $190 billion market by 2034. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, predicts 35,000 robotaxis in the U.S. by 2030, generating around $7 billion in revenue annually.
All of these figures are far below what Ives, Musk, and Wood predict. Could that trio be correct about Tesla's robotaxi potential? Absolutely. But given what other watchers are saying, investors should take a more cautious approach when modeling how fast and how big this business segment will become."

Tesla Investment Narrative Recap
To be a Tesla shareholder today, you need to believe that the company's transformation from a carmaker to a leader in real-world AI, robotics, and recurring software revenue streams will drive significant long-term value. The latest round of shareholder proposals, including calls for a child labor audit and board governance reforms, does not materially affect the most important short-term catalyst: rapid scaling of robotaxi and autonomous ride-hailing, while persistent regulatory and execution risks remain the largest immediate challenges to this vision.
Among the slew of recent announcements, Tesla's plan to eliminate supermajority voting requirements in its bylaws stands out. This move paves the way for simpler and more responsive shareholder decision-making and is particularly relevant as Tesla seeks broad buy-in for high-impact initiatives such as expansion of its AI-driven robotaxi service, which remains the focus of most growth expectations.
On the flip side, investors should be aware of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty around robotaxi and autonomy approvals in key international markets, as...

US stocks fell on Wednesday as Wall Street digested mixed messaging from Fed officials on interest rates.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by about 0.4%, The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.3%. The declines marked a reversal from the indexes' earlier gains.
Debate over the prospects for US interest rate cuts — the big focus for markets right now — appeared to pressure stocks. Comments from Federal Reserve officials this week have hinted at growing disagreement on what the path of policy should be, given cracks showing in the labor market.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in a speech on Tuesday that the central bank would proceed cautiously on further rate cuts, even as he left the door open to more easing. He also described stocks as ""fairly highly valued.""
Wall Street is now counting down to the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, on Friday. Markets are watching for reassurance that inflation isn't posing a threat to high expectations for two more rate cuts this year.
On Wednesday, fresh data from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed new home sales unexpectedly surged in August as mortgage rates began to ease, bringing homebuyers off the sidelines and releasing pent-up demand. Still, affordability concerns persist.
Meanwhile, some tech stocks are showing gains despite a broader drop across the Nasdaq, which snapped a winning streak on Tuesday amid losses for the ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks.
Alibaba stock (BABA) jumped 8% as investors welcomed the Chinese tech giant's pledge to hike its AI spending beyond its original $50 billion target. The boost is needed for Alibaba to keep pace as global investment in AI surges to $4 trillion, its CEO said.
Tesla (TSLA) shares climbed 4% and were on track to close at their highest level in 2025 as analysts at investing firm Mizuho Securities lifted their price outlook on the stock to $450. The analysts noted the EV maker is seeing only a ""muted"" impact from tariffs and boosted optimism for the company's robotaxi ambitions.
At the same time, Micron's (MU) stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings delivered a positive signal for the AI trade, though shares in the memory chipmaker — which supplies semiconductors for Nvidia's (NVDA) AI systems — fell on Wednesday.

- The Oracle cofounder's net worth exceeds Bank of America's $385 billion market value.
- Ellison's fortune has grown thanks to Oracle stock jumping 97% this year on AI optimism.
Larry Ellison is about twice as rich now than at the start of the year, and is personally worth more than Bank of America.
The Oracle cofounder's fortune grew by an unmatched $195 billion in 2025, reaching $388 billion at Monday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
That figure exceeds the $385 billion market value of Bank of America, which generated over $100 billion of revenue and $27 billion of net income last year, and ranks among the world's 30 most valuable public companies.
Ellison, Oracle's chairman and tech chief, is the world's second-wealthiest person after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who's worth $452 billion.
Ellison is more than $100 billion richer than Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos, who rank third and fourth on the rich list with fortunes of $269 billion and $250 billion, respectively.
Ellison owns about 41% of Oracle's stock, which has soared 97% this year to record highs. Investors expect Oracle to play a critical role in building the infrastructure needed to power the AI boom.
Oracle's contract backlog grew by over 350% year on year last quarter to $455 billion, as it struck huge deals with AI giants such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI.
CEO Safra Catz projected the company's cloud infrastructure revenue would rise 14-fold from around $10 billion last financial year to $144 billion in the year ending May 2030 — a sum that's about 2.5 times Oracle's total revenue of $57 billion last financial year.
Ellison's net worth has roughly quintupled within the past three years, as Oracle's shares have climbed from under $70 to $328 at Monday's close.
The billionaire, who lives on a Hawaiian island, also bought about 1.6% of Tesla before joining the board of Musk's EV maker in December 2018. The holding is worth over $20 billion today if he still has it.
He stepped down in 2022 and no longer has to disclose his stake."

Oracle founder and potential TikTok overlord Larry Ellison’s current net worth is estimated at $393 billion, making him the second-richest person in the world in 2025, only behind Elon Musk. His fortune has grown rapidly due to massive gains in Oracle’s stock, driven by the AI boom, and a significant stake in Tesla.
Ellison pledged to donate 95% of his wealth as part of the Giving Pledge in 2010. Since then, he’s distanced himself from traditional nonprofits and says he’s opting to give away wealth on his own terms. He founded the Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT), a for-profit philanthropic organization at The University of Oxford.
But Ellison’s EIT has recently been destabilized by leadership changes, according to a report in The New York Times. In 2024, he hired scientist John Bell to head the research. But in August, Ellison announced he had hired former University of Michigan President Santa Ono to “collaborate” with Bell. Just two weeks later, Bell announced his departure from the “very challenging project.”
The Times reports there are tensions over “how best to commercialize Mr. Ellison’s scientific research, along with persistent questions about how much the institute could trust Mr. Ellison to deliver on his financial commitments.”
Here’s what we know—and don’t—about Ellison’s plans to give away his fortune eventually.
Net worth (2025)
-
Estimated at $393 billion as of September 2025.
-
Most of his wealth derives from his 41% share in Oracle and a significant stake in Tesla.
Philanthropy and plans for giving
-
His main philanthropic focus is through the Ellison Institute of Technology, which aims to address global issues such as healthcare, food insecurity, climate change, and AI advancements, with a major new campus opening in Oxford worth approximately $1.3 billion.
-
In the past, Ellison has donated hundreds of millions to establish research and treatment centers, including a $200 million contribution to the University of Southern California for a cancer research center and approximately $1 billion in total to the Ellison Medical Foundation (now closed), primarily for medical research.
Amounts already given and future commitment
-
Direct charitable disbursements are less than those of some peers, but commitments to the Giving Pledge and the Ellison Institute total in the billions.
-
Key known contributions:
-
$200 million to USC for cancer research.
-
Over $1 billion to aging and disease prevention through the Ellison Medical Foundation, before winding it down.
-
$1.3 billion toward the Oxford Ellison Institute campus, set to open by 2027.
-
-
He continues to indicate nearly all his fortune will eventually be directed toward philanthropic causes—done on his own terms and timeline."

He oversaw construction projects, as well as the acquisition and leasing of more than 1.5 million square feet of warehouse, office and retail space. At Tesla, he served as Deputy General Counsel and Director of Real Estate, overseeing the negotiation of Tesla’s global headquarters as well as site selection for the automaker’s first Gigafactory.
""I’ve seen firsthand from my work at two of the world’s largest companies just how vital energy is to economic growth,"" Harmon said. ""The Nuclear Company’s focus on generating abundant, clean energy is essential to ensuring America’s role as the global economic leader.""

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said the AI space is already being ruled by a group of “big four” players.
The 69-year-old investor said OpenAI, Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and Google’s Gemini are competing for dominance—and the competition is fierce. She noted, ultimately, the four current competitors could be narrowed down to two.
“The number of companies competing, truly competing, in the large language model space has shrunk,” she told Bloomberg.
The recent “acquihires” conducted by OpenAI and Meta, which is not in Wood’s big four, are also examples of the AI space getting smaller and of “other companies not making it,” she said.
ChatGPT maker OpenAI has been one of the most prolific buyers in the startup space this year. In 2025 alone, the company shelled out $6.4 billion to acquire io, the hardware startup from former Apple designer Jony Ive, as well as $1.1 billion to buy product-development platform Statsig. These deals come as the company has also “acquihired” top talent from startups, including the team behind coding assistant company Alex.
Meta, for its part, conducted its own high-profile acquihire earlier this year when it committed about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in startup Scale AI and brought on its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, as its first-ever chief AI officer.
When it comes to AI consolidation, “the process has started,” said Wood, but the final result is still not in.
“Let’s see over time how they leapfrog one another, and they are doing that regularly,” she said.
ARK Invest’s star ARK Innovation ETF is up 47% year to date as of Tuesday, thanks in part to the stellar performance of its top holdings in 2025, including Roku, Coinbase, and Roblox. Its top holding, Tesla, is up a comparatively lower but solid 8% over the same period despite tumult earlier this year.
Wood, who earlier this year warned of stalling growth, has changed her tune and pointed to the possibility that inflation rates could drop to zero in the coming years as AI-driven productivity increases push inflation down. These productivity increases, however, have come hand in hand with higher unemployment and a Fed rate cut last week, which Fed Chairman Jerome Powell justified partly because younger people are struggling to find jobs.
Wood countered that these productivity increases could be good for the AI sector as a whole since companies are cutting back on employees but also increasing the money they put into AI services.

The Cybertruck is a bust, Stellantis just canceled the Ram 1500 REV, and even sales of Ford’s promising F-150 Lightning have been on the decline.
But the United States loves trucks. So is the key to making them love electric trucks… a very small one?
That’s the bet that California-based startup Telo has been making since its inception in 2022. The company has designed a bite-sized truck called the MT1 with an admittedly not-so-small starting price of around $41,000.
Now, investors want in on that same bet: Telo announced Tuesday it has closed a $20 million Series A funding round. The round was co-led by designer and Telo co-founder Yves Béhar, and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who is on Telo’s board. Additional investment came from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and early-stage funds like TO VC, E12 Ventures, and Neo.
In the world of automotive manufacturing, $20 million does not go very far. To contrast, Slate Auto, which is building its own wild take on a small electric pickup truck, has raised more than $700 million. Startups like Fisker Inc., Canoo, and Lordstown Motors also raised hundreds of millions before they all collapsed.
Telo has far more modest goals and a sharper aim than those companies, though.
“Our hyper-focus is on trucks for the downtowns of cities,” co-founder and CEO Jason Marks told TechCrunch on a video call while bouncing around Telo’s 10,000-square-foot San Carlos facility — which shares a backyard with the original Tesla headquarters.
While Telo may someday embrace other markets — Marks said some small farmers are quite interested in the truck — the company considers those to be secondary. It’s cities that Marks wants to conquer first; the CEO said he’s spent far too much time circling San Francisco streets looking for parking to focus on any other use case.
Telo is not promising to build hundreds of thousands of MT1s. Instead, it’s got a preorder list of around 12,000, and Marks said Telo initially plans to build around 5,000 per year via contract manufacturing.
“Our whole ethos is, what does it take to get to unit profitability as quickly as possible,” he said. “That’s positioned us differently than the other automakers who have come out and said, ‘Hey, we need a billion dollars to get to production.'”
The Series A funding will go toward building the final production-intent version of the MT1, homologating the vehicle to U.S. safety standards, and finishing crash testing. Marks said that last piece is key, because the MT1’s short front end has understandably inspired many questions about how safe the truck will be."

The investment was co-led by Asterion Ventures in Paris and Munich-based Leap435, alongside contributions from EIT Urban Mobility and US investors Zero Infinity Partners and Heroic Ventures.
The funding will enable Futurail to expand its workforce, execute projects with train manufacturers, and pursue regulatory approval for its initial project on depot autonomy.
Founded in 2023 by experts who previously worked at Tesla, Argo AI, and Edge Case, Futurail is focused on addressing the shortage of train drivers, which impacts the expansion and cost efficiency of rail services.

By GlobalDataFuturail CEO and co-founder Alex Haag said: “While leading the Autopilot team at Tesla, I saw how autonomy can completely transform an entire industry.
“We founded Futurail to bring that same revolutionary potential to rail, turning a 200-year-old industry into the backbone of sustainable mobility.”
The company’s FUTURAILDriver system is designed to be installed on both new and existing train fleets.
The firm is already collaborating with European and US partners to integrate and test its technology.
It already partnered with the Lohr Group, a French transport systems manufacturer, and Parallel Systems, a US startup developing battery-electric freight rail vehicles.
The firm’s technology is said to bring about a shift from road to rail transport, potentially reducing CO₂ emissions by more than ten million tonnes annually through increased rail use for passengers and freight.
Futurail co-founder and chief commercial officer Maximilian Schoffer said: “What excites our partners is that autonomy unlocks both growth and efficiency.
“Operators can run more trains, more often, at lower cost. That is a complete game-changer.”"

Cramer discussed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) last week on Monday after Elon Musk bought a billion dollars of shares. The CNBC TV host concurred with the CEO’s opinion that his company is a technology firm instead of being a car manufacturer. Cramer’s remarks are important since Tesla, Inc.

Cramer defended the package and advised those against it to sell the stock. Like Musk, Cramer also believes that Tesla, Inc.

Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Brooke DiPalma. We're live at the Nasdaq in Times Square. Let's turn now to some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street. We're taking a closer look at Tesla, Lulu Lemon and Johnson & Johnson. Tesla's stock seeing a small pop this morning after financial firm Mizuho raised its price target to $450. That's up from 375. The stock right now around 433. The analyst there said they see a quote much more muted US tariff impact. The firm also cited the proposed trillion dollar pay package for CEO Elon Musk, his recent billion- dollar stock purchase, and in the background, the growth potential for the robo taxi and humanoid robot adoption. Next up, we have Lulu Lemon, that stock reversing to the upside just a bit after it did fall in pre-market trading. Baird analyst cut its rating on the stock to neutral from outperform. That analyst cited a low near-term confidence in its margin and growth trajectory after that disappointing second quarter results that came out on September 4th. He also called the recent product innovation uninspiring in the US. Now year to date, the stock is down more than 50% and it's currently hovering around a six-year low, the first time since 2019. And Johnson and Johnson's stock got an upgrade from Guggenheim to buy from neutral. The firm said it's now comfortable with how the pharmaceutical company handled and navigated the loss of exclusivity for the autoimmune autoimmune drug, Stelara. It also expects innovation around medicine, well, that could lead to the next phase of growth for the brand. And that's today's top calls on Wall Street.

It’s obvious that things like mileage and condition affect the value, but color is another factor that can play a part in depreciation, especially, it seems, for certain Tesla Model Y colors.

Check Out: 5 Types of Cars Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying
A recent study from NexusMedia, using insights from EasySearch, looked at value retention across ten of the best-selling cars in the U.S in five common colors. The research measured the difference between a car’s original MSRP and what it’s worth today.
Tesla’s Biggest Losers
Looking at the popular Model Y, three colors were identified as losing more than half of their value:
-
Black Model Ys saw an average depreciation of 51.7% over five years.
-
Silver Model Ys saw an average depreciation of 50.9%.
-
Blue Model Ys saw an average depreciation of 50.4%.
All of these are above the national five-year average for 2025, which is 45.6%, according to NexusMedia.

Colors That Hold Up Better
Not every Model Y has such a dramatic drop in value, however. The research shows that red and white tend to hold their value much better, with red Model Ys dropping just 3.23% of their value, and white falling only 0.83%. That’s a 50.8% difference between a black and a white Model Y, translating to thousands of dollars on cars that are otherwise nearly identical.
Other Vehicles That Struggled
The Tesla Model Y wasn’t the only car with high depreciation, although no other models lost 50% or more of their value. Red Ford F-150s lost 43.3% of their value and blue F-150s were close behind at 42.6%. Blue Nissan Rogues showed a value depreciation of 40%, black Ford F-150s lost 38.2% and white F-150s lost 36.9%.
Why Color Matters So Much
When it comes to choosing a car, color may well be a personal preference, but the research shows the impact it can have on resale value down the line. Whether it’s because some colors might show wear faster, are less popular with secondhand buyers or simply go out of style sooner, it’s interesting to see that certain shades have fewer takers on the used market.
The Bigger Picture for Tesla
Even within Tesla’s lineup, the difference is clear. CarEdge estimates the Model Y loses roughly 60% of its value in five years, while the Model S drops even more at 71%. Understanding these trends can make a big difference when looking at resale potential. Color, combined with model, can quietly cost — or save –thousands of dollars over the life of a car."

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Aswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance, recently explained in a program on CNBC why he trimmed his stake in Tesla.
“It’s not because I don’t like the company. I like the company. If there’s any company where a CEO can reframe an electric car company into a robotics company, well, Elon Musk is that. I think my concern at with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has become a political stock and I’m terrible at politics. I don’t want to have investments or I’m trying to figure out what the politics of the model will look like. So my reason for selling Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) was not because I don’t like the company but because I don’t want my investments and politics to mix together.”
Tesla recently rallied after Musk bought back $1 billion worth of TSLA shares. Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.

Tesla's Model Y remained Europe's most popular battery-electric vehicle (BEV), but its sales dropped 37% from the same month last year despite growing BEV sales overall, data from the research firm showed.
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
Chinese automakers have ramped up exports of plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) to Europe and plan to build more models locally, minimising the impact of the European Union's tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.
PHEVs, which run on a combination of gasoline and electricity, are gaining in popularity as an affordable compromise between all-combustion and all-electric cars.
BY THE NUMBERS
Chinese carmakers had a combined market share of 5.5% in August with over 43,500 sales, up 121% from August 2024, the data showed. That was higher than Audi's 41,300 and Renault's 37,800.
PHEV sales in 28 European countries were up 59% in August to almost 84,000, with PHEVs of Chinese brands up 14-fold to 11,000.
BYD's Seal U, Chery's Jaecoo J7 and SAIC's MG HS were among Europe's 10 best-selling PHEVs.
BEV sales in Europe rose 27%, outperforming total market growth of 5%, the data showed.
KEY QUOTES
""There was strong demand for BEVs in August, however a 27% increase is less significant than it looks when you consider how widely they are being promoted,"" JATO Dynamics analyst Felipe Munoz said.
CONTEXT
BYD announced late last year it would start selling PHEVs in Europe. Earlier this month, it said it would make all its EVs for sale in Europe locally by 2028.

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) got a boost from Wall Street after Piper Sandler raised its price target to $500 a share, citing the company's advantage in artificial intelligence. The stock closed Monday at $436.64.
The firm said Chinese electric vehicle makers are advancing quickly but still look to Tesla for leadership in real-world AI. That includes the software behind Tesla's full self-driving fleet and its humanoid robot, Optimus two areas Piper expects to be major growth drivers over the next few years.
Analysts noted that investors may soon focus less on quarterly deliveries and more on the size of Tesla's installed fleet, which could unlock new revenue as the company monetizes vehicles already on the road.
Tesla shares are up about 48% year-to-date, supported by investor optimism around its AI roadmap even as competition in China intensifies. The company's next catalyst will likely be updates on its robo-taxi launch plans."

Pompano Beach, FL, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
Air Force Roofing founded by Joel Alcocer announced that it is now one of the few roofing contractors in South Florida qualified to install the Tesla Solar Roof a premium code ready roof replacement that generates clean electricity while delivering hurricane grade durability. The advancement positions Air Force Roofing to help Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach residents replace aging tile or shingle roofs with a Tesla Solar Roof that can cut energy bills while protecting homes to the highest industry standards.
Data backed savings made for Broward County. Fort Lauderdale households pay about $0.16 per kWh and use roughly 20,256 kWh per year. A properly sized Tesla Solar Roof can offset most or all of that usage. At today’s local rates offsetting 20,256 kWh equals about $3,240 in annual bill avoidance. Even a 10 kW Tesla Solar Roof that produces about 15,000 kWh per year would avoid about $2,400 annually before incentives. These figures reflect local EnergySage data for Fort Lauderdale and typical South Florida solar yield of about 1,500 kWh per kW year.
Federal Incentive. The Residential Clean Energy Credit (Internal Revenue Code Section 25D) provides a 30% federal tax credit for qualified residential clean energy systems including solar panels and solar roofing tiles such as the Tesla Solar Roof. This credit applies only to the solar portion of the project (panels or tiles inverters wiring and batteries if paired) and does not apply to unrelated non solar roofing materials or structural costs. The credit remains at 30% through 2032 then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring in 2035 unless extended by Congress.
Florida Incentives. While Florida does not have a state income tax credit it does provide:
-
100% property tax exemption on the added value of solar systems
-
Sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases
This means installing a Tesla Solar Roof in Florida qualifies for both the 30% federal tax credit on the solar portion and Florida’s state tax exemptions maximizing return on investment for homeowners.
Net metering support from Florida utilities. Florida’s statewide net metering rule enables customers of investor owned utilities including Florida Power & Light FPL to receive bill credits at the retail rate for excess solar generation with FPL applying a customary 115% sizing guideline relative to past usage. Credits typically roll over monthly with annual true up practices defined by utility tariffs. These policies are important levers in achieving the projected savings from a Tesla Solar Roof."

Amazon AMZN, however, has slipped 0.1% over the past one month.
What’s Behind the Rally?
Tesla recently grabbed headlines after CEO Elon Musk scooped up $1 billion worth of company shares. Retail investors cheered it as a vote of confidence. Agreed, Tesla’s core electric vehicle (EV) business is not doing great. But the company is striving to emerge as an artificial intelligence behemoth.
Tesla focuses on autonomous driving and robotics. It has recently received approval to begin testing its robotaxi, an autonomous driving ride-hailing service in Arizona, as quoted on an investors.com article.
The investors.com article went on to highlight that Nevada's Department of Motor Vehicles also gave the green signal to Tesla’s plans for testing its robotaxi service in the state. Tesla launched its robotaxi service in late June in Austin, TX. The ride-hailing operation expanded to the San Francisco Bay Area, with safety drivers, the article indicated.
Tesla Ramps Up Output in Giga Berlin
Tesla’s Giga Berlin plant in Grünheide is gearing up for a production boost through the remainder of 2025 amid growing demand, per Germany's DPA news agency, as quoted on Economic Times. The good sales figures are coming in even as Tesla faces stiff competition from Chinese peers in Europe.
Tesla to Report Record Deliveries Data?
Tesla stock lately received another boost as Piper Sandler analyst Alex Potter maintained an Overweight rating and raised its price forecast from $400 to $500, as quoted on Benzinga. Potter landed on this target price after a research trip to China, where he met with electric vehicle makers.
The analyst said that although Chinese automakers pose huge competition to Tesla, the U.S. EV behemoth has an edge over them when it comes to ""real-world AI,"" as quoted on the same Benzinga article. Benzinga went on to highlight that the analyst anticipated Tesla to deliver about 495,000 units in the third quarter, probably setting a record.
Any Wall of Worry?
Tesla is apparently a pricey stock. It is trading at a massively higher valuation compared with the Automotive – Domestic industry. Many AI-heavy Mag-7 members, including NVIDIA, do not boast as high a P/E (TTM) as Tesla.
Plus, Piper Sandler analyst Alex Potter is also less certain about Tesla's 2026 prospect, when Tesla targets 1.9 million units (as quoted on the above-mentioned Benzinga article)."

Analysts at the bank said in a note to clients that they have lifted their forecast to about 475,000 units, which is “~8% above Visible Alpha consensus,” though they added it is “more inline with buyside expectations in the 470–475k range.”
UBS raised its estimate from 431,000, noting that such a result would be up 3% year on year and 24% sequentially.
The firm expects Tesla to report on October 2. “Despite a print that may be inline with buyside expectations, we tend to find the stock does react to beat/misses vs. the headline number,” UBS said.
Several factors inform the higher forecast. UBS highlighted “strong deliveries in the US as Tesla pushes, and consumers take advantage of, the $7,500 IRA EV tax credit before its expiry at the end of September 2025.”
The bank added that the quarter could mark “the highest quarterly US deliveries since mid-2023 and potentially the highest ever,” while warning demand is likely being pulled forward, pointing to a sequential drop in Q4.
Europe is also said to be trending better, with deliveries in the top eight markets up about 22% quarter-on-quarter through the first two months. In China, retail deliveries rose roughly 45% quarter-on-quarter, and UBS also flagged “strong delivery growth” in Turkey and South Korea.
UBS expects deliveries to exceed production by about 7%, helping reduce the inventory that built up in Q2. The bank maintained its full-year forecast of 1.62 million vehicles for 2025, but projected just 428,000 in Q4, down 14% year on year.

- Uber Freight and Tesla have joined forces to introduce a Dedicated EV Fleet Accelerator Program that offers subsidies for fleets to buy Tesla Semi electric trucks, according to a Sept. 16 press release.
- Participating carriers are required to enter into a contract with Uber Freight where they “must dedicate their Tesla Semis and associated drivers exclusively to Uber Freight for the length of the contract,” according to the brokerage firm's frequently asked questions.
- The program aims to address the price gap that exists between electric trucks and traditional diesel trucks.
Dive Insight:
Before embarking on the buyers program with Tesla, Uber Freight worked with a group of carriers to pilot the Dedicated EV Fleet Accelerator Program.
The two-month pilot program covered over 394 hours of drive time and 12,377 miles.
“With an average net energy consumption of just 1.72 kWh per mile and only 60 hours of total charge time, these results highlight the operational viability of Tesla Semis on demanding freight lanes,” per the release.
There are still gaps left to make widespread adoption of EVs for freight possible, such as significantly increasing the amount of charging infrastructure.
With the buyers program, fleets are advised to operate within routes supported by Tesla’s public charging network. “Operations are permitted outside of Tesla’s public charging network but finding options to charge may be difficult,” per the company’s website.
Uber Freight has also taken action to address the logistical complexities associated with EV freight transportation. In 2023, it announced its first electric truck pilot with WattEV and CHEP. Under the agreement, WattEV provided its trucks to Uber Freight shippers, beginning with CHEP, and trucks charged using WattEV’s infrastructure.
During the same year, the broker announced a collaboration with Greenlane to accelerate the development and installation of public charging infrastructure for heavy duty battery electric vehicles. Uber Freight was tasked to augment Greenlane’s data to determine corridors that are prime candidates for early HD BEV deployment.
“Optimizing truck charger locations remains a complex task with many variables, including shippers’ locations, grid readiness, throughput time-of-day, locations of truck depots, and land availability,” per a 2023 company press release."

(Reuters) -Telo Trucks has raised $20 million in an oversubscribed Series A round to make its compact electric pickup, as the startup bets on a capital-efficient model to succeed in a market littered with failed EV challengers.
The funding, led by Telo co-founder and designer Yves Béhar and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, shows investors are still willing to back entrants despite a string of bankruptcies that followed the post-pandemic EV listing boom. Other investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, E12 Ventures and Nova Threshold, Telo said on Tuesday.
""The graveyard of electric vehicles from the last 20 years almost all spent billions of dollars chasing high-volume production. What we’re doing is bringing a unique product to market that doesn’t exist right now and stepping our way into volume the way Tesla did with the Roadster and Model S,"" CEO Jason Marks told Reuters.
The startup says it can stay capital efficient by using contract manufacturing while focusing its own resources on battery packs, design and crash safety engineering.
Founded in 2023, Telo Trucks has built the MT1, an all-electric mini pickup designed for U.S. cities. Roughly the size of a two-door Mini Cooper, the MT1 can fit five adults and a five-foot truck bed, matching the cargo capacity of larger pickups.
The San Carlos, California-based company has over 12,000 pre-orders from city municipalities, construction firms and delivery companies, among others, representing over $600 million in potential revenue. Still, questions loom over whether startups like Telo can avoid the fate of peers that went public via blank-check mergers only to collapse under cash burn and missed targets.
“If we can deliver just over half of the 12,000 reservations, we can hit unit profitability. Our strategy is about getting to profitability at low volume, not chasing 150,000 units a year,"" Marks said.

That has put both Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.17%) and Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) in a tough spot, but one company appears to be on a better track than the other at the moment. Here's what investors need to know.
Rivian's potential is coming into view
Rivian proved its potential earlier this year with two straight quarters of gross profit, meeting a goal management had set. The company slipped back to a loss recently as tariff costs weighed on results, but investors still got a glimpse of how Rivian can achieve its financial targets while keeping profitability in focus.
What's more, Rivian is on the verge of launching new vehicles that should appeal to a wider customer base. The company's smaller SUV, the R2, is slated to go on sale in early 2026 at a price tag of around $45,000. That's far cheaper than its cheapest models and significantly lower than the average EV price of about $57,000. The R2 will be the first of a handful of cheaper vehicles in Rivian's pipeline, with a smaller R3 and R3X also eventually on the way, with an estimated starting price of about $37,000.
Investors will have to wait to see how customers respond to Rivian's new vehicles, but they're certainly a step in the right direction for expanding Rivian's customer base and spreading the cost of production across multiple vehicles. Production efficiency has been a goal of the company lately, with Rivian reengineering portions of its manufacturing process last year -- saving 35% in material costs.
Another check mark in the pro column for Rivian is the fact that it's building strong partnerships and developing solid sources of funding. The most recent is a partnership with Volkswagen, in which Rivian supplies some of its technology to the automaker in return for $2 billion in funding. Rivian could receive up to $5.8 billion if the company continues meeting agreed-upon goals.
Tesla has a rough road ahead
Tesla was once a dominant force in the EV industry, but its fortunes have taken a turn as of late. For one, the company's operating income plunged 42% in the most recent quarter to $923 million, and its free cash flow fell 89% to just $146 million. Tesla said the decline came, in part, because of dwindling regulatory credit sales, lower vehicle deliveries, and higher operating expenses.
Tesla's net income tumbled 16% in the quarter to $1.1 billion, and operating margin fell to 4.1%, down from 6.2% in the year-ago quarter. Rising competition, higher costs, and a bruised brand thanks to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement are all putting pressure on the company.
Some investors are hopeful for a turnaround. Tesla's stock recently got a bump after Musk purchased $1 billion worth of shares. The purchase was likely a way for Musk to signal to Tesla's board that he's committed to the company as he seeks a pay package that's worth up to an eye-popping $975 billion, if certain goals are met.
But Tesla faces serious challenges. Declining profits and shrinking cash reserves limit its ability to reinvest just as Musk is pushing the company to expand into new growth areas, including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Without the profits and cash to do so, it's a big question whether the company will be able to pivot to these new industries -- or even if it should.
Rivian is the better EV stock, but success isn't guaranteed
I'm optimistic about Rivian because I think the company is building a strong EV lineup, and I've been impressed with how management has adapted to an increasingly difficult EV environment.
While Rivian's success is nowhere near guaranteed -- especially given the difficult EV environment -- I think it's the better EV stock right now. Tesla's falling profits and shrinking cash availability put it in a tough spot as it tries to transition to robotics and AVs. Investors will still need to be patient with Rivian, though, as the company navigates a challenging period for the EV industry."

SAN CARLOS, Calif., Sept. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- TELO Trucks, maker of the first electric mini truck built for U.S. cities, today announced its oversubscribed $20M Series A funding. This funding round was led by legendary designer Yves Behar, and Marc Tarpenning co-founder of Tesla and Venture Partner of Spero Ventures. Additional investment came from TO VC, E12 Ventures, Neo, Marc Benioff, Uncorrelated Ventures, Nova Threshold, MCJ, and others.
TELO Trucks stands out in the market with a new category of trucks that meets a critical need for functionality across both consumer and fleet audiences. The TELO MT1 delivers the capabilities of a full-size crew cab work truck in the footprint of a 2-door MINI Cooper.
Yves Behar, co-founder of TELO Trucks said:
""I have great confidence in the TELO team as we build a future-proof vision for mobility. The MT1 proves that innovation can deliver smarter design, greater practicality, and uncompromised capability, shaping how we'll all move tomorrow.""
Marc Tarpenning, Venture Partner at Spero Ventures said:
""TELO has the vision, product, capital efficiency, and manufacturing strategy to make the next great transportation company.""
This round follows TELO's $6M strategic Seed round, led by Neo, and their previous $2M Pre-Seed, led by GoAhead Ventures.
Capital Efficiency
TELO has demonstrated a first-of-its-kind effort in capital efficiency. With only $8M raised over the past three years, TELO launched two fully realized pre-production prototypes that have already earned critical acclaim from the automotive media. This overtakes other automakers who have required in excess of $50M to achieve the same milestone, making TELO the most capital efficient automaker ever.
Joshua Phitoussi, Managing Partner at TO VC said:
""Disciplined scale-up is the name of the game in auto manufacturing. Many companies have made the fatal mistake of scaling up too fast, with too few proof points of product-market fit. TELO, on the other hand, has a liquid and well understood bill-of-materials, and CAPEX-light manufacturing model that leans on blue-chip partners, and 12,000 reservations that get the company well past profitability. This team has shown that they can execute with scarce resources. We're excited to see what they can do now with strong funding and long-term partners.""
With this new tranche of capital, TELO intends to reach production readiness and pass all federal requirements to get the TELO MT1 on the road."

Its EV sales have declined, as have its profit margins and its share of a market it almost single-handedly established. The company also arguably misstepped by focusing on releasing a higher-priced refreshed model Y when the market appears to be moving toward more budget-friendly options. Still, Tesla remains the best-positioned company in the EV automaker landscape.
Two reasons why Tesla is the pick of the EV sector
There are two key differences between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV markets. First, the former is characterized by a relatively low upfront cost/high maintenance and fuel costs, while the EV market is the opposite, with high upfront cost/low maintenance & fuel costs. Therefore, reducing the upfront cost of an EV has a higher impact on its economic value than the same reduction on an ICE vehicle.
The second is that traditionally, automakers sold cars and struggled to generate significant after-sales revenue. In comparison, recurring revenue is a vital component of Tesla's business strategy.
Tesla can win out
Lowering costs in EV production requires building scale, which in turn lowers the price of vehicles and increases sales volumes. While Tesla's sales have declined this year, it remains the dominant market player, and the introduction of lower-cost models, starting later this year, is likely to boost its sales growth in 2026.
As for after-sales revenue, the company has a huge opportunity to generate a recurring stream of income through selling full self-driving (FSD) subscriptions. This is likely to increase markedly if and when Tesla releases unsupervised FSD, not least because it can be used to transform Teslas into robotaxis. On top of that, Tesla's robotaxi concept in general (including dedicated Cybercab vehicles) offers a massive opportunity to generate revenue sharing from robotaxi rides."

While the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12% so far in 2025, major semiconductor exchange-traded funds are by far outperforming the market.
And while companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom are having solid years, they need a company to actually fabricate the semiconductors that they're designing. That's where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%) comes into play, and why it's one of the most consequential stocks on Wall Street right now.
About TSMC
Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry. It makes advanced semiconductor chips for multiple companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, AMD, and others. The company says it used 288 different process technologies to produce nearly 12,000 products in 2024, proving its broad capabilities to literally any type of client.
According to research by The Motley Fool, 60% of the company's revenue comes from manufacturing its specialized 3 nanometer (nm) and 5nm chips. The transistor sizes are important -- a nanometer is 1 billionth of a meter, so the more transistors TSMC can squeeze into a semiconductor chip, the faster it can work.
Back in the second quarter of 2022 -- which is not that long ago -- TSMC earned 30% of its revenue from 7nm chips. But now it gets a full 36% of its revenue from 5nm chips and 24% from 3nm chips, according to The Motley Fool's research.
TSMC is one of four companies that make 3nm chips at scale, in addition to Samsung, Intel, and Xiaomi. TSMC and Samsung already have plans to mass-produce the 2nm process in 2025.
To say the chips are in high demand is an understatement. TSMC announced that its revenues in August were $11.13 billion, up 33% from a year ago and up nearly 4% on a sequential monthly basis.
The company is investing $165 billion into building new production facilities in Arizona to fabricate semiconductors domestically, which will help it get around any trade issues between Beijing and Washington.
Other ways that TSMC makes money
While the high-powered 5nm and 3nm chips make up the lion's share of TSMC's revenue, it also has other sources:
Smartphones (27%): TSMC's semiconductors helped make 5G smartphones function. 5G was one of the biggest developments of the smartphone industry in this decade, allowing customers to access the internet with connections as speedy as a broadband connection. 5G's higher data speeds allow for high-resolution video, real-time gaming, and quick downloading speed.
While the percentage of TSMC's revenue stream involving smartphones fell from 33% to 27% in the last year, this is still a critical space for TSMC. Apple highlighted the company's partnership with the fabricator in August when it announced a $600 billion commitment to manufacturing in the U.S.
Internet of Things (5%): TSMC's revenue from Internet of Things devices fell from 6% to 5% in the last year. This involves a variety of products including smart home devices, smart city devices, and wearable technology. Examples include smartwatches, industrial sensors, medical monitors, lighting, speakers, and robotic vacuums that don't need high-powered 3nm or 5nm chips to function.
Automotive customers (5%): This includes companies like Tesla, which are working to make autonomous driving a reality. This also involves creating chips for electric vehicles, driver assistance systems, and in-car infotainment systems.
The bottom line
TSMC is continuing to advance its technology to create smaller transistors in order to fabricate more powerful chips, and as long as it continues down this path, it will remain the world's top and most significant chip fabricator. That gives it an essential position in today's AI-driven stock market, making Taiwan Semiconductor stock for investors to consider."

That discount is due to the company's lackluster growth rates in recent quarters. But looking ahead to 2026, Rivian's growth rates should skyrocket. And there's one major reason for this impending growth spurt.
Why does Rivian trade at a discount to Lucid Group and Tesla?
According to many valuation metrics, Rivian trades at a sizable discount to other electric vehicle (EV) makers like Tesla and Lucid. Rivian, for example, trades at a price-to-sales ratio of around 3. Lucid shares, meanwhile, trade at around 7 times sales, with Tesla stock trading at an astounding 15 times sales.
Why does Rivian trade at such a steep discount? There are two primary reasons.
First, Rivian's historical and projected growth rates leave a lot to be desired. Since 2025 began, Rivian has grown revenues by just 3%. Lucid, meanwhile, has grown sales by around 15%. Looking ahead, Rivian is expected to grow sales by just 6% this fiscal year. Lucid, meanwhile, is projected to grow sales by around 61% this fiscal year.
Based on these growth statistics, it seems reasonable for Rivian to trade at a discount to Lucid. But here's where things get a little weird. Since 2025, Tesla has actually seen its sales decline by 5.1%. This fiscal year, Tesla is expected to experience a total sales decline of around 4.9%. Why then are Tesla shares trading at such a premium?
This brings us to the second reason why Rivian trades at a discount to competitors like Lucid and Tesla. The company doesn't have a clear path toward competing in the global autonomous robotaxi market. Experts like Cathie Wood believe the global robotaxi market could eventually be worth $10 trillion. Tesla has a clear path toward participating through its robotaxi division, which launched in Austin, Texas earlier this year. Lucid, meanwhile, recently partnered with Uber Technologies to supply its robotaxi division.
What about Rivian? So far, we haven't heard much about the company's aspirations in this category, potentially leading the market to undervalue the stock. But I predict that Rivian's growth rates should pick up aggressively next year regardless of the company's current lackluster growth rates or its inability to get involved in the robotaxi hype over the short term.
Rivian should see sales explode higher in 2026 and 2027
One of the biggest challenges for an EV maker is getting affordable models to market. And by affordable, we're talking about a starting price of under $50,000. Nearly 70% of all U.S. car buyers are looking for a vehicle under this price threshold for their next purchase. Lucid doesn't currently have any models priced under $50,000, severely limiting its growth potential. Tesla, meanwhile, has only two affordable models: the Model 3 and Model Y. Amazingly, these two models account for more than 90% of its total vehicle sales!
As Tesla has proven, getting affordable models to market is critical for achieving mass scale. Lucid is still a couple of years away from this milestone. But Rivian should get its first affordable model to market by early 2026, with two additional affordable models to follow. This has the potential to transform the business. Again, more than 90% of Tesla's sales comes from its two affordable models, and Rivian expects to launch three over the next 18 months.
So, while Rivian doesn't have much immediate exposure to the robotaxi market -- an opportunity that should persist for decades to come, giving Rivian plenty of time to catch up down the road -- expect the company's growth rates to pick up considerably in 2026 and 2027. In hindsight, the company's valuation discount versus Tesla and Lucid could be a giant mistake by the market."

Economic data releases and earnings
Oh, the love-hate relationship with quarterly earnings.
On the one hand, business media loves us some quarterly earnings!
Each quarter, a company releases its financial numbers, providing transparency to its investors. We listen to high-profile executives hop on a webcast and talk about every single positive known to man, from revolutionary new products to how one-time expenses mean nothing. (All of this is said tongue in cheek.)
If you are a CEO of a company kicking butt, how can you not love earnings season? You come out, beat big on earnings estimates, the stock explodes, your wealth increases, year-end bonus prospects go up, you plan out your next 10 hard asset purchases (homes, watches, cars, etc.). It's as intoxicating as sucking down a fifth Aperol spritz on a Bahamian beach.
As for those companies sucking wind, well, earnings season isn't your friend. I have nothing to say to you right now except try harder for your investors.
I bring this up because President Trump has stirred up a debate around doing away with quarterly earnings in favor of semiannual reporting.
If we are inclined to build wealth steadily over time, doesn't that better align with hearing from companies twice a year with a more detailed snapshot of the business? Execs will still update investors on the business at investor conferences and on networks like Yahoo Finance.
So, why not let them drive the business with the long term in mind instead of trying to make a quarterly number through various tactics?
""I think I'd be OK either way,"" Okta (OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon told me on Opening Bid (video above). ""I do like the opportunity to talk to investors every quarter about the business and the future and the vision of what we're trying to do.""
Still, he added, ""I do think sometimes the industry gets too obsessed with the quarterly numbers ... from a single quarter.""
There are detractors to Trump's idea, naturally.
""It undermines transparency,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren told Yahoo Finance this week.
Here are three other changes to quarterly earnings — and corporate governance broadly — President Trump should consider. Do you have ideas? Send them to me on X @BrianSozzi or @BrianSozzi on LinkedIn.
Do away with garbage earnings
As a former analyst, I appreciated it when companies released adjusted earnings numbers. They made my life much easier from a financial modeling perspective. Now that my analyst days are long over, I've come to detest non-GAAP-adjusted earnings numbers."

Meta seen as long-term AI leader after smart glasses push
William Blair reiterated its positive view on Meta Platforms after the company’s September 17–18 Meta Connect conference, which demonstrated the tech giant’s advances in AI and wearable technology.
The broker described the event as “an evolution on Meta’s wearable AI technology,” pointing to four new smart glasses models developed with Oakley and Ray-Ban.
These additions expand Meta’s AI-driven wearables lineup, which now supports tasks from reading texts and playing music to more advanced features thanks to upgrades in video quality and battery life.
William Blair noted that affordability will be key for mainstream adoption. “For this technology to hit the mass market, the price point likely needs to decrease to around $200,” it wrote, estimating penetration could reach about 30% at that level.
Beyond hardware, the firm remains constructive on Meta’s broader AI efforts.
“We continue to be positive on Meta’s AI adoption and the benefits to both consumers and advertisers, and believe the company will be a long-term AI leader,” it stated.
Based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a 10% discount rate and an 18-times EBITDA multiple, William Blair projected about 25% upside for Meta shares over the next year.
The broker maintained an Outperform rating while cautioning on risks such as privacy issues, regulatory scrutiny, slower user growth, advertising pullbacks, and shifting engagement trends.
Tesla upgraded at Baird on shift toward ‘physical AI’ future
Baird on Friday lifted its rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Outperform, saying investors are increasingly focused on the company’s role in what it calls a “physical AI” era.
The investment bank raised its price target to $548 from $320, a level it says reflects Tesla’s long-term potential.
“Relatively muted stock reactions following a series of less-than-stellar quarters and investor inbounds regarding long-term initiatives lead us to believe focus has increasingly shifted to the future for TSLA,” analyst Ben Kallo said in a Friday note.
Despite three quarters of softer results, Tesla shares have climbed 24% over the past month, compared with a 3% rise for the S&P 500. “We now expect shares to Outperform as TSLA is increasingly viewed as the leader in physical AI,” Kallo added.
Kallo highlights Tesla’s proposed new pay package for Elon Musk, which links rewards to ambitious operational and financial milestones. The framework includes targets such as producing 20 million vehicles, reaching 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, putting 1 million robots and 1 million robotaxis on the road, and achieving a market capitalization of up to $8.5 trillion."

While shares have soared recently due to founder and CEO Elon Musk's $1 billion stock purchase, this remains a very polarizing business. There are valid arguments coming from both bulls and bears as to Tesla's merits as an investment.
Is this top electric vehicle (EV) stock a buy, sell, or hold right now?
Concerns around valuation
In the past decade, Tesla shares have climbed 2,300% (as of Sept. 18). This phenomenal gain is a direct result of the company's success disrupting the global auto industry with its innovative and tech-forward EV fleet. Sales have trended higher over time, and the brand is now widely recognized.
However, the stock has overreached. Investors who wish to buy the stock must pay a hefty price tag with shares boasting a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in nosebleed territory at 246. This valuation is a convincing enough reason alone for many Tesla shareholders to sell out of their position -- such a high valuation introduces a major headwind to achieving solid future returns.
Tesla's (possible) future
To make matters worse, Tesla's automotive revenue declined 16% year over year in the second quarter, and its operating income tanked 42%. A growing backlash against Musk's public profile and increased competition have led to struggles for the EV segment.
That said, many investors believe that Tesla will look totally different five or 10 years down the road. They're betting that the company's newly launched Robotaxi business and other technologies like humanoid robots could eventually lead Tesla to higher sales and earnings. The success of those ventures is anything but certain, however, despite how much they may be propping up the current valuation.
For much of Tesla's existence as a publicly-traded company, the stock has been highly speculative, and that remains the case now -- the risk-reward profile simply doesn't make sense at these levels."

As the race to develop artificial intelligence that rivals human cognition heats up across China, Europe and the U.S., a similar competition is unfolding in the electric vehicle industry.
Automakers like Tesla, BYD and Volkswagen are competing for consumers in the growing global transportation market with features like double-laminated glass, sustainable materials, tray tables and a frunk — a front trunk.
Each region brings its own approach. China's top EV models blend affordability with tech, European EVs blend sustainability and refinement, and the U.S. emphasizes performance and luxury at scale.
Chinese EV standouts
While not available for purchase in the U.S. due to trade restrictions, Chinese electric automakers emphasize the latest technology while maintaining affordability.
BYD Dolphin
The electric hatchback prioritizes affordability, with the European market price starting at €22,900, or $26,701, for the 200-mile range batteries. The cost is €26,207, or $29,138, for vehicles with 315-mile range.
The EV’s design mimics “ocean aesthetics,"" with front and rear lights inspired by dolphins breaching, according to the company website.
Inside, the Dolphin offers a floating center console, a large center display with integrated voice command and four colors with corresponding interiors.
The EV can reach 100km/h, or 62.14 mph, in seven seconds.
Xiaomi YU7
Launching in June, the Xiaomi YU7 is a high-performance luxury SUV that emphasizes advanced design, technology, driving experience and safety.
It comes in three versions:
- Standard, ¥253,500 or $35,447
- Pro, ¥279,900 or $39,138
- Max, ¥329,900 or $46,130
The YU7 boasts “industry-leading airtightness” to reduce outside noise. The Max version adds double-laminated glass to cut wind and other noise by two to three decibels.
All vehicles are equipped with a Xiaomi HyperEngine V6 Plus. The Max version reaches 253 km/h, or 157.21 mph, per hour and accelerates to 100km/h in 3.23 seconds.
Notable European EVs
While some European models like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV are produced and sold in the U.S., these models are only sold overseas:
BMW iX1 eDrive20
Unlike its gas-powered counterpart, the X1, the iX1 eDrive20 is not available in the U.S., and BMW has no plans for a North American rollout.
Though EU law prohibits fixed pricing, the recommended retail price during its launch was €47,900, or $55,756.
Additionally, the iX1 can accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in 8.6 seconds and its top speed is electronically capped to 170km/h, or 105 mph.
On the interior of the vehicle, the model offers a navigational system, two-zone automatic air conditioning, a parking assistant, a back-up camera and an upgraded curved screen.
Škoda Elroq
Fashioned by its chrome-accented bumper logo, Škoda, Volkswagen’s Czech subsidiary, offers a modern driving experience serving Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its award-winning SUV, the Elroq, features fast-charging technology, enabling drivers to recharge from 10% to 80% of its battery in 28 minutes.

Whether it is worth buying depends on your risk profile.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=867b6377ec2f12e3fe1dfc156f77866a17ee37d278f3b469085ff8234e993f6d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/is-rivian-stock-a-buy-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/is-rivian-stock-a-buy-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/is-rivian-stock-a-buy-now/,fool.com,200,,"Rivian (RIVN 2.17%) stock got caught up in a bit of Wall Street hysteria when it went public. In fact, that hysteria is likely why the vehicle maker went public, so it could cash in on the hype around electric vehicles (EVs) at the time. When the excitement wore off, Rivian's share price plunged.
Is the story starting to, very slowly, change for the better again?
Wall Street likes a hot story
It wasn't too long ago that Wall Street believed that electric cars were going to change the world. Tesla, after a long period of building its business, had finally proven that making EVs could be a sustainably profitable business. And, importantly, that the traditional automakers had to start taking EVs seriously. The excitement around Tesla led the stock to rise dramatically.
Wall Street jumped into action, as it usually does in such situations. A slew of electric car companies rushed to go public, attempting to catch Tesla's ""lightning in a bottle."" Many of those companies were too early in their development to justify going public, but you have to strike while the iron's hot in finance if you want to collect the initial public offering (IPO) cash, and the lush investment banking fees that go along with that cash.
That may seem a bit cynical. The truth is probably a bit more complicated, since you could also argue that Wall Street was simply giving investors what they wanted. Regardless, a lot of electric car companies have flamed out, and there is still a material risk that more will do the same. And despite all of this investment drama, Rivian continues to make important progress as a business. So much so that its stock has risen materially off its post-bubble lows.
What's got investors interested in Rivian again?
As the chart above highlights, Rivian's stock is around 85% below its all-time high. But that's an improvement from the 91% nadir, hit in 2024. Since hitting that low, Rivian's shares have risen from $8.40 per share to their current value of around $14, an increase in value of roughly 66%! What's going on?
Simply put, Rivian is slowly building its business, at least partly thanks to the cash it raised when Wall Street was more enthusiastic about the idea that pure-play electric car makers would disrupt the businesses of the traditional automakers. To be fair, Rivian is dealing with far more competition than Tesla was when it broke into the auto industry. In fact, all of the major auto companies are now making their own EVs. But Rivian has continued to make important progress as a business.
For example, the company has twice generated a gross profit. That simply means that it generated enough revenue from selling cars to cover the cost of making those cars. There are other expenses further down the income statement, like research and development and SG&A costs, that will keep Rivian in the red for years to come. But a gross profit is an important first step.
It also counts large and important companies as partners. The list includes Amazon, which has long been a material customer, helping Rivian develop a delivery truck that Rivian now sells to other customers. And the other big one is traditional automaker Volkswagen, which continues to provide cash to Rivian as the upstart reaches new development milestones. The expectation is that Volkswagen will use Rivian technology in its vehicles, thus providing Rivian with another important customer.
Another vital step has been the company's ability to reach production scale. That was actually what allowed it to shift gears to focus on profitability as it fine-tuned its manufacturing efforts. It will use what it has learned to take the next big step, which should happen in 2026, of introducing a new lower-cost vehicle, the R2, for the mass market. That, not incidentally, is the same approach Tesla took, starting at the high end and then bringing out lower-priced vehicles.
Will Rivian make it?
When asking if Rivian is worth buying, the underlying question is really ""Will Rivian make it?"" The answer to that is uncertain, so only the most aggressive investors will probably want to look at Rivian today, even as the stock rises off its lows.
However, if you are an aggressive growth investor, it increasingly looks like Rivian may have what it takes to reach sustainable profitability. And if it does, the current low price could signal a good time to buy. That said, Rivian is still a developing business, so the ride could still be a little rough and, as noted, there's always the risk that Rivian falls short of its ultimate goal."

The stock initially rocketed higher, but then sold off intensely, as poor performance in the EV business and the effect of tariffs hit the company hard.
But since April's lows, the stock has rebounded almost 90% and trades close to all-time highs made in late 2024. CEO Elon Musk seems to like what he's seeing and just purchased $1 billion of Tesla stock himself. Is now the time for investors to go all in?
Leaping hurdles from earlier this year
Following Trump's election win last November, Tesla's stock surged. There didn't seem to be any specific reason, other than Musk's ties to Trump and expectations for an easier regulatory landscape for Tesla. But as Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) proved to be controversial and his relationship with Trump soured, the ""Trump bump"" seemed to fade, especially as Tesla's core EV business struggled as well.
Tesla reported a disappointing 337,000 deliveries in the first quarter of the year, the lowest number in over two years, and second-quarter deliveries of 384,000 were still down 14% year over year. Competition seems to have caught up with Tesla in certain markets. Tariffs and the upcoming elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit also presented challenges for the business.
However, it didn't take investors long to look past the poor results in Tesla's core business. Instead, they chose to focus on the company's burgeoning robotaxi business and future humanoid robots. Tesla has done a soft launch of its robotaxi fleet in Austin and San Francisco, and is hoping to soon launch in Phoenix. It's hard to tell how far along the programs are. Media reports have suggested that most, if not all, of Tesla's robotaxis are geofenced with either remote human monitoring or actual safety monitors in vehicles during trips.
But investors are excited by the progress. They also believe that Tesla will be able to build its robotaxi fleet more cheaply than rivals like Waymo. Musk also said that he thinks Tesla could have over a million robotaxis on the road by the end of 2026. However, he's made big calls like this before, only to miss the timeline.
Additionally, Musk's recent purchase of $1 billion of stock -- which comes after Tesla's board of directors just proposed a nearly $1 trillion pay package to Musk over the next decade -- is a clear indicator to Wall Street analysts that the company is moving in the right direction.
""We are becoming more bullish,"" William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a recent research note. ""This purchase is Musk's first buy since 2020. To us, this sends a strong signal of confidence in the most important part of Tesla's future business, robotaxi.""
Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a recent note that he expects Tesla deliveries to come in at around 465,000 in the third quarter, above consensus estimates of 430,000 and flat year over year.
Should investors go all in?
If Tesla could report deliveries that were flat year over year, that would be a good indicator to the market that the company is shoring up problems it had in the first half of the year. Deliveries in Q1 were down nearly 50% year over year.
However, with the U.S. EV tax credit expiring on Sept. 30, EV makers may see a boost in sales due to people trying to take advantage of the savings before they're gone. So Q3 earnings could be a one-off.
Either way, I still find Tesla's stock to be far too expensive for my taste while it's trading at a forward earnings multiple of roughly 247. In my opinion, investors are baking in too much good news from robotaxis and humanoid robots too fast, making the risk-reward proposition less favorable."

The electric vehicle (EV) maker sells premium cars, a growing suite of energy-storage products, and paid software for its vehicles, e.g., Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. The mix of hardware and software, combined with ongoing innovation, makes the story unusually dynamic -- and it's why quarterly updates carry extra weight.
Shares have rebounded from their lows this year, making the bull case now depend less on near-term delivery growth and more on whether Tesla can expand margins through software and energy while investing in autonomy and robotics. After all, these are the things that will really move the needle for Tesla over the long haul. So, that is the frame for the upcoming report: Numbers matter, but the destination matters more.
A rough patch
Financial results at Tesla this year have been disappointing. In its second quarter of 2025, total revenue was $22.5 billion, down 12% year over year. Automotive revenue fell 16% as deliveries slipped and average selling prices declined. Automotive gross margin was 17.2%, down from 18.5% a year ago, with the company citing lower prices and fewer regulatory credits as headwinds. Operating expenses also weighed on results as the company leaned into artificial intelligence (AI) and product road map development spending.
But Tesla's energy generation and storage business were a highlight, with segment gross margin of 30.3% in the quarter and 29.6% for the first half, driven by lower unit costs on Megapack and Powerwall even as average selling prices eased. Deployments totaled 9.6 gigawatt hours (GWh) in Q2, and Tesla says it deployed 20 GWh through the first half of 2025.
Helping the company work through this period of weak demand and high spending is Tesla's strong balance sheet. Through the first half of 2025, net cash from operating activities was $4.7 billion, while cash and cash equivalents stood at $15.6 billion and short-term investments at $21.2 billion as of June 30.
The bigger picture and valuation
Ultimately, though, Tesla stock isn't a story about numbers -- at least not right now. Management has been explicit about where the company is heading: heavier investment in AI, software, autonomous driving, and robotics. Investors will be looking for Tesla to present evidence and arguments that make them believe these aspirations will turn into major business drivers over time.
For now, Tesla's soaring energy business helps ease concerns, as it demonstrates how the company can introduce a new service or business and grow it into something massive. Storage margins in the 30% range are meaningful, and product cadence continues: Tesla introduced new Megapack 3 and Megablock systems in September, underscoring the push to serve utility and data-center demand. At the same time, quarterly energy deployments can be lumpy, so sustained margin quality and backlog detail will be important signals in the next update.
The bull case for Tesla stock, however, can't be entirely dependent on future plans. At roughly $426 per share as of this writing, the market is assigning a premium that assumes continued software monetization and progress on autonomy and robotics today. That premium may be warranted if Tesla shows rising software revenue recognition, firmer automotive margins, and continued energy strength. But if auto pricing pressure persists and software contribution remains modest, today's price could prove unforgiving, especially with shares trading at more than 250 times earnings as of this writing.
For long-term investors weighing a buy before earnings, patience may be the best choice. This doesn't mean the stock is likely to fall after the earnings report. There's no way to know what will happen. There's simply a lot of uncertainty, and the stock's valuation already prices in many of the company's long-term aspirations. More clarity is needed to justify buying the stock at this price."

Further, Citadel beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) by 9 percentage points during the last three years, which makes his portfolio a good place for individual investors to find inspiration.
Griffin made several noteworthy trades during the second quarter. He sold shares of Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) for the fourth consecutive quarter, slashing an already-small position by 30%. He also added shares of Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), increasing his position by 900% such that it now ranks as his second-largest holding.
Interestingly, Nvidia has returned 1,100% since the artificial intelligence (AI) boom began in January 2023. But Griffin consistently sold the stock (reducing his exposure in seven of the previous eight quarters) before his big purchase in 2025's Q2. Citadel now has more money invested in Nvidia than at any point since 2022, suggesting Griffin was too quick to sell and has since realized his mistake.
Here's what investors should know.
Tesla: The stock Ken Griffin sold in the second quarter
Tesla's electric car business is struggling. Automotive sales have declined in three straight quarters as the company has navigated increased competition, elevated interest rates, and brand damage caused by CEO Elon Musk's political activities. The company lost more than 3 percentage points of market share in the last year as Chinese automaker BYD became the global leader in electric car sales.
However, Tesla has a substantial opportunity in autonomous driving technology. It recently introduced its first commercial autonomous ride-sharing (robotaxi) service in Texas. The company is also testing its vehicles in California, and it recently won approval to begin testing in Nevada. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates robotaxi revenue will reach $84 billion by 2035.
Importantly, while Tesla trails the market leader Alphabet's Waymo -- which has commercial autonomous ride-sharing services in five U.S. cities -- the company arguably has an edge. Whereas Waymo relies on a costly sensor suite that requires city streets be mapped in extensive detail beforehand, Tesla relies solely on computer vision, which is less expensive and more scalable.
Meanwhile, Tesla is also developing an autonomous humanoid robot called Optimus. Musk says it will account for as much as 80% of the company's value in the future, telling analysts earlier this year, ""Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue."" Tesla hopes to manufacture at least a million units annually within five years.
Tesla currently trades at a 170 times forward earnings based on estimates for 2026, which make it the third-most expensive stock in the S&P 500. Put bluntly, the company is wildly overvalued if it fails to deliver on robotaxis and autonomous robots. But the current price may appear reasonable in hindsight if it executes on those opportunities. Investors will have to decide which outcome they see as most likely.
Nvidia: The stock Ken Griffin bought in the second quarter
Nvidia dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips often called artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators because they speed up demanding workloads like AI training and inference. Nvidia has over 80% market share today, and many analysts think the company will maintain that level for the foreseeable future.
Nvidia dominates the AI accelerator market not only because its chips consistently deliver superior results when benchmarked against alternatives but also because the company complements its GPUs with adjacent networking hardware and central processing units (CPUs), as well as software tools that streamline the development of a wide variety of AI applications.
Blayne Curtis at Jefferies last year highlighted that competitive moat in a note to clients. ""Nvidia is in control of the ecosystem on both the hardware and software front, and their current cadence of new generations should make that lead only [grow] further,"" he wrote. Indeed, while Nvidia just recently started shipping its latest GPU (called Blackwell), its next generation GPU (called Rubin) will launch next year.
Looking ahead, Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its momentum. CEO Jensen Huang expects AI data center expenditures to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by the end of the decade, up from about $600 billion today. That means its addressable market will grow at least 400% in the next five years, which implies annual revenue growth in the upper 30% range at a minimum.
Indeed, Wall Street estimates Nvidia's earnings will increase at 36% annually during the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 50 times earnings seem quite reasonable. Patient investors with a time horizon of at least three years should feel comfortable buying a position in this semiconductor stock today."

There are multiple levels to the size of this goal, and all of them point to the same outcome a year from now. That's why only the most aggressive investors should be looking at Lucid today.
Lucid is making progress
It would be easy to be negative about Lucid, but the fact is that the upstart electric car company is making important progress as a business. For example, it delivered 38% more vehicles in the second quarter of 2025 than it did a year earlier. It dramatically improved the bottom line of its income statement, as well. But there are negatives in those positives.
For example, the company only delivered 3,309 EVs in the second quarter. That's barely a rounding error for a company like Tesla, which delivered 384,122 vehicles. The legacy automakers, against which Lucid is also competing, have even larger businesses. One year won't fix Lucid's scale problem, even if it continues to grow its production.
Then there's the bottom line. Despite the improvement, Lucid still lost $0.28 a share in Q2 2025. That's better than the $0.34 per-share loss in the same quarter of 2024, but the company continues to bleed red ink onto its financial statements, and badly. Once again, that's not going to change in a year, given that the company is still spending heavily to ramp up its production.
Moving very slowly forward
So where will Lucid be in a year? Probably not very far from where it is today -- a money-losing EV start-up that is likely to be years away from turning a sustainable profit. Most investors will probably want to watch this one from the sidelines."

When it comes to memes, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is a fan. But when it comes to calling his electric vehicle company a ""meme stock,"" he's not amused. One investing expert, however, argues that Tesla deserves the meme stock label given its current valuation.
What Happened: Tesla has often traded with a valuation higher than its automotive peers, a valuation that Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes should be a reality.
While experts argue whether Tesla should trade with a valuation of an automotive company or a technology company, the current valuation is significantly ahead of both sectors.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Sharing thoughts on Musk's new compensation package, Yale School of Management Senior Associate Dean Jeff Sonnenfeld didn't hold back with the meme stock analogy.
""This is the biggest meme stock we've ever seen,"" Sonnenfeld said in an interview with CNBC.
The investing expert highlighted the price to earnings ratio of Tesla being above 200. On Benzinga Pro, the PE ratio is 253.5x on a trailing twelve-month basis and 169.5x on a forward basis.
""Even at its peak, Amazon was nowhere near this level. The PE on this, well above 200, is just crazy. When you've got stocks like Nvidia, the price-earnings ratio is around 25 or 30, and Apple is maybe 35 or 36.""
Sonnenfeld said Tesla's valuation is ""crazy.""
""They've, I think, put a little too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk.""
Why It's Important: Asked about the new compensation plan for Musk, Sonnenfeld said it was ""foolish"" and ""reckless"" of the board and will turn into shareholders' problems.
The investing expert said no one is worth $1 trillion in compensation. Sonnenfeld also said that if Musk leaves Tesla, as he hinted at as a potential without a higher ownership percentage, he would be the person most impacted if the stock went down.
""He'd be the biggest loser,"" Sonnenfeld said.
In his interview, Sonnenfeld praised Musk’s talent and said there might not be anyone smarter or more entrepreneurial.
""He's a brilliant guy.""
See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
As for the premium valuation, Sonnenfeld also warned against shorting the stock.
""People shorting haven't done well due to timing.""
Last month, Musk issued a warning to investors betting against the electric vehicle company.
""If they don't exit their short position before Tesla reaches autonomy at scale, they will be obliterated,"" Musk said, referring to a list of the top companies with short positions in the stock.
Sonnenfeld said he hopes that a succession plan is laid out for Tesla with someone new ready to take the company into the next phase. The expert highlighted Tesla losing market share in Europe and China with BYD dominating in certain markets.
""There isn't a part of the world where Tesla isn't falling under Musk.""
The expert said it's time for Musk to move on and time for someone who ""won't cost a trillion dollars"" to lead the company.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been upgraded by an analyst following the announcement of a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk, which creates opportunities for shareholders.
The Tesla Analyst: Baird analyst Ben Kallo upgraded Tesla stock from Neutral to Outperform and raised the price target from $320 to $548.
Analyst Takeaways: While Tesla's vehicle segment has faced setbacks and declines, investors are likely looking to other segments of the company and future growth, Kallo said in a new investor note.
""Investor inbounds regarding long-term initiatives lead us to believe focus has increasingly shifted to the future for TSLA,"" he said.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The analyst said there could be ""physical AI inflection ahead,"" with Tesla now viewed as a leader in the AI sector.
Kallo said the new proposed pay package for Musk has lofty goals and, like past versions, creates new incentives for Musk and the company for the next decade.
He noted that the new pay package is used in the model to present the latest opportunity for the company and is part of the reason for the upgrade and new price target.
Kallo breaks down the pay package milestones, which are based on Tesla's market cap, product goals around vehicle deliveries, FSD subscriptions, Optimus Bot deliveries, robotaxis in operation and adjusted EBITDA.
""Assuming TESLA achieves these milestones in 2035 with volumes approximately equal to the minimums outlined in the pay package, we see a pathway for TSLA's market cap to exceed $5.5 trillion.""
See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Based on comments from Tesla regarding its future revenue drivers and opportunities, as well as the new pay package milestone, Kallo estimates that Tesla stock could be worth between $1,400 and $3,000 in 2035. ""The road ahead is chock-full of catalysts.""
Items highlighted by Kallo in the report include robotaxis, Musk's pay package getting approved, the next generation of Optimus revealed, growth of the Tesla Energy business, launch of the Tesla Semi and more affordable electric vehicles.
The analyst said all these items are events that ""could move the stock.""
The recent purchase of around $1 billion in Tesla stock by Musk is also highlighted by Kello as ""a positive sign."""

The Financial Post explores those stories and more in The Week in Stocks.
Stock of the Week: Intel Corp.
Shares of Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC) surged as much as 30 per cent this week, with most of the gains coming on Thursday after Nvidia Corp. announced it would purchase US$5-billion worth of the beleaguered computer components producer and chipmaker’s shares. Nvidia also said it would jointly develop a data centre and other projects with Intel. The move comes weeks after the United States government took a 10 per cent stake in the company as it looks to boost semiconductor manufacturing at home. But analysts at TD Cowen think the deal represents a way for Nvidia to get the U.S. administration to unlock chip licences for the Chinese market. “We view today’s news of Nvidia meaningfully supporting a top Trump priority — reviving Intel — as a potentially significant step toward Nvidia winning over the MAGA transactional advisers and gaining Blackwell licences for China,” Paul Gallant said in a note. Blackwell is the name of a type of Nvidia chip. As for Intel’s shares, several major investing houses hiked their price targets, including Roth Capital Partners LLC, which lifted its target to US$30 from US$22, while Cantor Fitzgerald LP increased its price target for the shares to US$36 from US$26. Shares were trading Friday around the US$30 level.
Buy on the dips in the U.S. and believe in Canada, says BMO
“Canadian equities remain well-positioned to keep pace with the U.S. … period,” BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski said in a research paper updating the bank’s best investment ideas strategy. Canadian stocks are at the tail end of an earnings recovery that started in mid-2024, with profitability normalizing and growth now expected to reach double digits. “Despite narrowing valuation divergence of Canada versus the U.S., we continue to believe the Canadian small-cap universe is undervalued, underinvested and ripe with growth opportunities, even relative to their large-cap peers,” he said. With markets in the U.S. and Canada hitting fresh highs, worries about stocks being overpriced compared with earnings have especially dogged U.S. markets. However, Belski thinks the Wall Street bull market will continue to charge ahead and recommends investors “stay the course and use any potential periods of market weakness as a buying opportunity.” He also said U.S. stock gains are spread more broadly beyond the Magnificent Seven, whereas previous gains had been more concentrated. Belski believes there are opportunities for investors in the small- and medium-cap names. BMO analysts added new names across several sectors, from energy and health care to real estate and utilities. The updated “best of” list for financials is comprised of all new names, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSX:CM), Cincinnati Financial Corp. (Nasdaq:CINF), Goeasy Ltd. (TSX:GSY), Manulife Financial Corp. (TSX:MFC) and TransUnion (NYSE:TRU)."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-20T00:05:00,"Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Become the First $6 Trillion Company, According to a Wall Street Analyst",Beth Kindig of the I/O Fund thinks Nvidia will become a $6 trillion stock by next year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9ba80ee51e73751d6ca1d2d3db4368960b850d7331015cfb319a80a6bdd744a5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,fool.com,200,,"Beth Kindig, CEO of the technology research firm I/O Fund, has built a reputation for bold calls in the tech sector. Much like Cathie Wood's long-standing conviction in Tesla, Kindig has consistently expressed unwavering enthusiasm for semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%).
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Kindig sparked debate after revealing her forecast that Nvidia could reach a $6 trillion market cap by the end of next calendar year -- implying roughly 43% upside from its current levels.
Below, I'll outline the logic behind Kindig's projection and then examine the key drivers that, in my view, lend credibility to her thesis.
What would it take for Nvidia to reach a $6 trillion valuation?
The vast majority of Nvidia's revenue is driven by its data center segment. In the second fiscal quarter (ended July 27), Nvidia reported $41.1 billion in data center sales -- a 56% increase year over year. This translates to an annualized run rate of roughly $160 billion.
Kindig argues that the probability of Nvidia reaching $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue by year end -- or a $200 billion annual run rate -- is ""very high,"" given the company is still in the early stages of scaling its next-generation Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPU architectures.
She further contends that Wall Street is underestimating capital expenditure (capex) trends across AI hyperscalers. In her estimation, analysts are not fully modeling the scale of demand for Nvidia's GPUs.
Kindig's math suggests that surging investment in infrastructure could push Nvidia's data center operation to $75 billion in quarterly sales ($300 billion annual run rate) by the end of next year -- implying 50% growth compared to her 2025 year-end figures.
Of course, understanding the arithmetic is just one piece of the story. The larger question is why I share Kindig's bullish stance -- and what's truly at stake for Nvidia as AI infrastructure spending accelerates.
What are the pillars supporting Nvidia's data center growth?
At the core of Kindig's thesis is hyperscaler capex spending. The world's largest cloud providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- are committing unprecedented sums to expand compute power, setting the stage for the next phase of the AI era.
The rationale is straightforward: As AI workloads grow and new applications emerge, both training and inference require increasingly sophisticated infrastructure. With hyperscalers doubling down on budgets, Nvidia is positioned to be the primary beneficiary as its GPUs remain the backbone of these AI services.
Consider robotics as an example. Companies like Amazon and Tesla are investing in systems that can navigate warehouse operations with human-grade precision. Training physical systems to interpret and engage with real-world environments is far more complex than the reactive large language models (LLMs) that power today's chatbots. Such advancements require massive GPU clusters -- precisely the systems Nvidia delivers.
Autonomous systems in transportation, manufacturing, and defense follow a similar trajectory. Moving from proof-of-concept to commercial deployment will drive an exponential increase in demand for compute. Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and its successors are designed for this leap -- combining efficiency with processing power that makes Nvidia an indispensable supplier for enterprises building mission-critical workflows.
At the same time, cloud infrastructure is undergoing its own major transformation. A new wave of GPU-as-a-service agreements is gaining momentum, with companies renting access to GPU capacity through providers such as Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nebius Group.
This model creates a multiplier effect for Nvidia whereby the company is not only supplying GPUs to the hyperscalers, but it's also partnering with specialized cloud operators that lease its hardware downstream. As businesses increasingly adopt multi-platform cloud strategies, they distribute workloads across several providers. In turn, this expands Nvidia's footprint in the swiftly evolving AI hardware ecosystem.
Is Nvidia stock a buy now?
Taken together, these catalysts create powerful secular tailwinds supporting Nvidia's long-term growth. The company's expanding data center business is not merely a byproduct of hyperscaler infrastructure investment; rather, it is the inevitable outcome of structural shifts driving the next generation of AI applications.
At a high level, the precise timing of a $6 trillion valuation is less important than the underlying trend: Nvidia is well-positioned to remain the dominant force in AI infrastructure. Against this backdrop, I think the stock offers meaningful alpha potential and makes for a compelling long-term position."

The social network, formerly known as Twitter, posted about $707 million in revenue in the three-month period through June 30, a 2.2% drop compared to the first three months of the year, according to people briefed on the numbers. Still, that’s more than a 20% increase in sales from the same period in 2024, partly helped by the election and post-campaign surge, when Musk was spending much of his time directly alongside President Donald Trump.

A spokesperson for X didn’t reply to requests for comment. The numbers were disclosed to private investors last week.
After Trump’s November election win, Musk’s closeness to him helped draw investors to the company, and also pushed at least some advertisers to spend on X in hopes of currying favor with Musk and the administration.
Much has happened since then: The pair feuded publicly on social media, then Musk swore off politics and turned his focus to other parts of his empire, such as his artificial intelligence company xAI and his electric car maker, Tesla Inc.
The figures suggest that X’s business has started to stabilize after years of uncertainty following Musk’s initial takeover. Even so, revenue was down 40% from the same quarter in 2022, the last time Twitter reported earnings before going private, a sign that the business is still meaningfully smaller than it was.
Advertising, which historically had been the key growth driver of X’s business, has taken a back seat to subscriptions and data licensing products, Bloomberg reported.
On top of that, Linda Yaccarino, a long-time advertising veteran who was CEO of X, left in July, paving the way for the network to lean harder into a new identity as a source of data for artificial intelligence training, supporting xAI’s chatbot Grok.
The company’s business has fluctuated over the past year. X’s gross profit in the second quarter was down 24% from the first quarter of this year, but was still up more than 30% from the same quarter last year, the people said. The firm also boasted almost $360 million in ebitda, or annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization without financial adjustments. That’s also slightly down from the start of the year, but up 33% from last year’s second quarter."

Just had a great design review today with the Tesla AI5 chip design team! This is going to be an epic chip.
-- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 6, 2025
And AI6 to follow has a shot at being the best by AI chip by far.
Switching from doing 2 chip architectures to 1 means all our silicon talent is focused on making 1...
Tesla's efforts to move into custom silicon could be significant for the company's next-generation products -- but what might they mean for semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia?
What is the AI5 chip, and why does it matter?
AI5 -- and its successor AI6 -- are simply Tesla's internal codenames for its next generation of custom chips. While Musk's comments may fuel a debate over which company is designing the most advanced silicon, investors should look past the surface-level narrative. His underlying message points to something larger: Tesla is pursuing deeper vertical integration of its technology stack.
The rationale is straightforward. By consolidating its high-end computing onto a single family of purpose-built chips, Tesla gains greater control over both performance and cost -- and can streamline engineering cycles and accelerate product development. From a financial perspective, this strategy also has the potential to improve unit economics by reducing supply chain risk and expanding profit margins over time.
How do these investments impact Tesla's AI ambitions?
Tesla's AI ambitions can be divided into two categories: self-driving cars and humanoid robotics. While these markets target different end users, the unifying theme is autonomy.
Importantly, autonomy will not be achieved as a singular breakthrough -- it will be the product of constant iteration. Both Tesla's robotaxis and its Optimus robots rely on taking in fresh real-world data and using machine learning loops to steadily become ""smarter"" and more capable over time.
Is this a checkmate move against Nvidia?
Given the context above, it's critical to note that Nvidia remains the leader in powering the training side of AI workloads. Tesla may have bold ambitions in custom silicon design, but the key question for investors is whether its efforts could truly disrupt Nvidia's dominance in the data center landscape.
At present, I see that as highly unlikely. Nvidia's entrenched position -- anchored not only by its hardware but also by its widely used CUDA computing platform -- gives the company broad ecosystem advantages. Coupled with its rapid pace of product development -- it rolled out its Blackwell Ultra GPUs earlier in this quarter, and will launch its next-gen Rubin GPUs in 2026 -- these factors make it difficult for any competitor to materially erode Nvidia's lead in AI infrastructure at this time.
Nvidia's dominance is not solely a function of its chips. Rather, the company's comprehensive hardware-software stack creates immense friction for enterprises considering moving some of their business to rival platforms. This creates a formidable technological moat and durable competitive advantage for Nvidia.
With this in mind, the broader takeaway is that Nvidia's flywheel is unlikely to come to a sudden halt simply because one company is choosing to become more self-reliant. While Tesla may eventually compete with Nvidia in the autonomous vehicle chip market, it is quite likely to remain a complementary player -- or even an Nvidia customer -- when it comes to AI training protocols.
Against this backdrop, Tesla's progress in developing its own infrastructure is notable, but those efforts are still in their early stages. All the while, Nvidia continues to roll out improved successor architectures to its already industry-leading GPUs.
The bottom line is that while Tesla may find ways to meet some of its chip needs in-house over time, it is still far from achieving a checkmate position against the AI chip leader."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.4% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, adding about 0.7%, as Apple (AAPL) stock rallied on optimism over its new iPhones hitting store shelves.
All three major indexes hit all-time highs for a second session in a row, ending the week on an upbeat note as the dust settled on the Federal Reserve's return to interest rate cuts. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq cinched their third straight weekly gains, adding 1.2% and 2.2%, respectively. The Dow climbed 1%, marking its second consecutive weekly gain.
Save for Nvidia (NVDA), the Mag 7 tech stocks all posted gains for the five trading sessions through Friday, led by Tesla (TSLA). Tesla ended the week up nearly 8%, while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) added around 6% and Apple jumped almost 5%.
Investors on Friday were focused on details from Trump's conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The US president said in a post on Truth Social following the talks, ""We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal.""
The details of the TikTok deal — which would allow the social media app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance to continue US operations amid an impending ban — are not yet clear. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the agreement would involve a consortium of investors including Oracle (ORCL), Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz taking an 80% stake in the company.
Notably, a summary of Trump and Xi's talk in Chinese state media did not provide a detailed update on a TikTok deal beyond saying that Xi supported a commercial solution to the problem and that he wanted a set of rules that would allow Chinese companies to invest in the US.
The writeup from China also said that the US should avoid new restrictive trade measures to avoid ""undermining"" recent trade talks.

Elsewhere in markets, nuclear stocks including Oklo (OKLO) and NANO Nuclear (NNE) rallied amid optimism in the sector. Meanwhile, chipmaker Micron (MU) pulled back from a record high ahead of its quarterly report which lands Sept. 23. AI chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) ended the week down 4% after a big upswing last week.
LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 19 updatesMicron falls from record ahead of earnings
Memory chipmaker Micron (MU) saw its shares fall more than 3% Friday, sinking from a record close of $168.89 in the previous trading session as investors await the company's quarterly earnings report Sept. 23.
Despite the pullback Friday, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock.
JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterated his Overweight rating on Micron shares Friday, noting ""AI demand growth"" and ""rising hyperscaler capex budgets.""
Micron's memory chips are used in Nvidia's (NVDA) GPUs (graphics processing units) for AI, and ""hyperscale"" AI data center operators such as Meta (META), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) have been continuously upping their capital expenditures to increase their computing capacity as they rush to meet AI demand.
TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar said his own note, ""We think MU stock will continue its outperformance in the short term as checks continue to support that momentum.""
Overall, analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect the chipmaker to report earnings per share of $2.83 and revenue of $11.1 billion for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year.

Sep 19 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rises after receiving a boost on Friday after Baird shifted its rating to ""Outperform"" from ""Neutral"", calling the EV maker the leader in physical AI. The upgrade arrived despite expectations for near-term volatility, with the firm noting that investor attention has moved beyond recent uneven results toward Tesla's long-term initiatives.
Analyst Ben Kallo pointed out that muted stock reactions following weaker quarters and growing inquiries from investors signal a shift in focus to Tesla's future roadmap. Baird highlighted several potential catalysts, including the upcoming reveal of Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, expansion of its U.S. robotaxi business, plans for more affordable vehicles, and the shareholder vote on CEO Elon Musk's compensation package.
Shares of TSLA climbed 3% on morning trading, extending a 25% rally over the past six weeks. Tesla will report Q3 deliveries in less than two weeks, a closely watched metric for gauging demand.
With momentum building around AI-driven products and mobility services, the firm's endorsement reflects optimism that Tesla can extend its reach beyond EVs into the broader AI ecosystem."

Or rather, what is the bond market assuming its next move will be? The good news for interest rate doves is that the market, initially at least, is pricing in lower interest rates on the way, which would be great news for interest-rate-sensitive stocks like Whirlpool (WHR -1.16%) and Tesla (TSLA 1.39%).
What the latest moves mean for investors
The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 11-1 in favor of the rate cut, with one dissenting member voting for a more aggressive 0.5-percentage-point cut. The rate cut was accompanied by a decline in bond market benchmark 10-year Treasury yields and a decrease in 30-year mortgage rates.
Moreover, the bond markets are pricing in more near-term rate cuts. This is implied by examining the 10-year, two-year, one-year, and six-month Treasury rates. In normal circumstances, the 10-year rate should be the highest, and the six-month rate the lowest; this reflects the greater risk associated with longer-dated bonds due to a possible increase in interest rates.
Indeed, the 10-year yield is the highest; however, note that the six-month rate is higher than both the one-year and two-year rates. This implies that the market expects rates to go lower within one to two years.
What it means for Whirlpool
Lower mortgage rates tend to help make housing more affordable for borrowers, which can lead to more home sales and new home construction. More housing and sales is a plus for domestic appliance makers like Whirlpool. Individuals often remodel their homes before selling and after buying a new one. As such, the higher-margin discretionary demand for household appliances tends to follow existing home sales.
Whirlpool has struggled this year due to weak discretionary demand, and an improved U.S. housing market would definitely help boost sales. In addition, Asian competitors have preloaded the market ahead of tariff implementation, thereby creating a highly competitive price environment. Lower rates could boost demand and help clear the market's excess appliance inventory.
With the current tariff landscape in place, Whirlpool's competitiveness (the company makes roughly 80% of what it sells in the U.S. within the U.S.) is likely to improve significantly in the future, and it's set to be a big winner from the Trump administration tariffs.
Tesla could also be a winner
Housing is interest rate sensitive, and so is buying a car on credit. Much of the attention on Tesla's falling sales has been focused on CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and/or the automaker's aging vehicle lineup. The reality is that while Tesla's Model Y sales have slumped in 2025, sales of its Model 3 are growing strongly, and it's not a coincidence that the Model 3 is Tesla's lowest-priced vehicle.
It's also not a coincidence that Tesla is losing market share in the SUV (Model Y) market, as affordable competitors like the budget-priced Chevrolet Equinox SUV have aggressively grown their sales. In contrast, Tesla decided to refresh the Model Y in 2025, and in doing so, released a more expensive model.
Still, Tesla is already making plans to react and is set to release a lower-cost model in the near future. The expiration of federal tax credits for EVs at the end of September will hurt the market. Still, lower interest rates would offset the impact and also boost Tesla's release of lower-cost models, including a lower-cost Y model, and possibly a new affordable car (Model 2?) in 2026.
In addition, making EVs more affordable with lower interest rates would boost sales, as the initial cost of an EV tends to be relatively high, but its running costs are relatively low. As such, a lower interest rate environment could boost Tesla's EV sales in 2026 as it continues developing its robotaxi rollout."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's Neuralink has taken its experimental brain chip north of the border, launching its first clinical trial outside the U.S. at Toronto Western Hospital.
Two Canadians with paralysis have already received the wireless implants as part of a study testing whether the devices are safe and effective. Within minutes of surgery, doctors said both patients were able to move a computer cursor with their thoughts. The trial is now recruiting six more participants with spinal cord injuries or ALS. Neuralink first implanted a device in an American patient in 2024.
The move is stirring debate in Canada. While some hail the breakthrough for its potential to restore independence to people with severe disabilities, critics question the hospital's partnership with a company tied to Musk. The billionaire has clashed publicly with Canadians, at one point calling the country not a real country despite being a Canadian citizen himself.
For investors, the trial underscores Neuralink's global ambitions and the scrutiny that comes with Musk's involvement. Results from Toronto could be a key test of whether the technology scales."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 5.9% on the news that CEO Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion of the electric-vehicle maker's stock, a move viewed by investors as a significant vote of confidence in the company.
According to regulatory filings, Musk acquired roughly 2.57 million shares in open-market transactions the previous Friday. This represents his first open-market purchase of Tesla stock since February 2020 and his largest ever by value. The disclosure sent shares surging as investors reacted positively to the news.
Dan Ives of Wedbush noted that the move ""is a huge sign of confidence for Tesla bulls and shows Musk is doubling down on his Tesla A.I. bet."" Adding to the positive sentiment, Barclays raised its third-quarter delivery forecast for Tesla to 465,000 vehicles, well above the consensus estimate of 430,000 units. The company also reportedly plans to accelerate production at its Berlin factory to meet strong European demand.
Tesla is up 11.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $423.81 per share, it is still trading 11.7% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,829.

Consequently, the company’s free cash flow has fallen to $146 million from $1.34 billion recorded in the year-ago period. However, its capital expenditure continues to trend upward and reached $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 as the automaker continues to make investments in manufacturing projects such as the Cybercab, Semi line, other production initiatives and the expansion of its AI programs.
Despite heavy capital investments, Tesla's efforts have so far not translated into revenue growth. In the second quarter, its total automotive revenues declined nearly 16% year over year. Whereas its energy generation and storage revenues, which once followed an uptrend, have also started declining. The company attributes the year-over-year decline to the negative impacts of the bill and tariffs. However, lower-than-expected demand for EVs and the political stances of CEO Elon Musk are often considered the prime suspects behind the automaker’s deteriorating performance.
With the end of U.S. tax credits and potential price cuts, higher capital spending will pressure Tesla’s near-term free cash flow. However, the company expects the impact to ease once autonomy scales, which could significantly strengthen cash flow in the second half of next year. TSLA carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.

Let's turn now to some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street. We're watching Intel, FedEx and Tesla. First up, we have Intel, that stock is under a bit of pressure after City Group downgraded the stock to sell from neutral. You can see it's down more than 1% this morning, pointing to the company's quote, rich valuation. Now, keep in mind, the stock had rallied 23% on Thursday after Nvidia agreed to invest $5 billion in the company. Now the analysts there are saying that the stock is pricing in success in its leading edge foundry business, which he believes has minimal chance to succeed. Once again, that stock under a bit of pressure this morning. Plus FedEx, that stock moving higher this morning after getting price target boosts following its quarterly report. Now the report which beat on both the top and bottom line, also pointed to revenue growth of 4% to 6% for the fiscal year, and that really eased some of Wall Street's concerns. They had going into the quarterly report. We did hear from JP Morgan and Bank of America, both of which increased their price targets following that report. And on the flip side, its competitor UPS, well, that's stock got a downgrade from BMO Capital markets. It's under a bit of pressure this morning.

TSLA is exploring a redesign that would integrate the electronic and manual door-release mechanisms, which are currently positioned separately, per the Bloomberg News podcast with Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s chief designer, cited by Reuters. The change aims to make door handles more intuitive, particularly in a panic situation.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched an investigation into roughly 174,000 Model Y vehicles from the 2021 model year following reports that electronic door handles may fail. While Tesla cars include manual release options inside, the agency noted that children might struggle to reach or operate them, even if drivers are aware of their presence.
Per NHTSA, the issue seems to arise when the electronic door locks do not receive enough voltage from the vehicle. Per repair records, the problem was often resolved by replacing the low-voltage battery, but owners reported that no low-battery warnings appeared before the exterior door handles failed.
Both Tesla and NHTSA declined to comment to Reuters. Per the Bloomberg report, cited by Reuters, the company is reviewing reports that a top Chinese regulator may consider banning fully concealed door handles. Since 2018, NHTSA has received more than 140 consumer complaints regarding Tesla doors becoming stuck, failing to open or malfunctioning.
In 2023, Tesla recalled more than 120,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in the United States due to the risk that doors could unlock and open during a crash. TSLA carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.

Tesla’s Rival Addressing Safety-Related Concerns
Ford Motor Company F is recalling 101,944 Taurus sedans in the United States due to a defect that may cause the B-pillar trim on the driver and front passenger doors to detach while driving, per NHTSA. If the trim comes loose, it could fall onto the roadway and create a hazard. Ford dealers will examine the affected vehicles and repair or replace trim, free of cost.
Stellantis N.V. STLA is recalling around 164,000 Jeep vehicles in the United States over an issue involving the potential detachment of door trim. The recall applies to a few Chrysler Jeep Wagoneer and Jeep Grand Wagoneer models manufactured between 2022 and 2025. The dealers will examine the vehicles and replace the trim if needed at no cost to owners.

“I think they’ve definitely got the pole position in autonomous and robo taxis, much more so than Tesla.They’ve got the right cost profile because they’re not picking up the cost. Waymo is. So, I think they’ll do quite well in the earnings because even though prices have gone up, you know, from what I’m hearing, demand hasn’t suffered. So, it all adds up to put up a good quarter.”

Brown Advisory Large-Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), a global mobility platform, delivered a solid quarter, demonstrating continued strength in its core rideshare and delivery businesses. The company reported healthy growth in trips and bookings, with robust demand and expanding margins. While the stock has experienced some volatility over the last several quarters due to concerns about competition from potential autonomous vehicle offerings, especially from Tesla, Uber’s business remains resilient, with no signs of a consumer slowdown and international markets performing especially well. The partnership with Waymo in Austin is also off to a strong start, exceeding expectations. Management remains focused on both innovation and operational excellence, while ongoing share repurchases reflect their confidence in Uber’s long-term outlook.”

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Jeff Kilburg from KKM Financial said in a program on CNBC late July that he was planning to sell Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares despite the idea sounding “crazy.” Here is how the analyst explained his decision:
“I want to sell Nvidia. I know it sounds crazy, but Nvidia at a new all-time high of $175. I want to sell Nvidia, take profits and the reason is because of the overconcentration. If you see the NASDAQ, we’ve talked about the NASDAQ right now. It’s on its 65th day of being above its 20-day moving average. So, a little long in the tooth, but this is momentum. This is the V-shaped recovery. So, by selling Nvidia, I want to buy Apple nearly the lagger. Tesla is just below Apple in the MAG 7. So, I think there’s an opportunity. If you want to short Nvidia, this is not for you. You will have a very hard time shorting Nvidia. But there’s an opportunity to either sell or trim position. I blindly bought Nvidia back in April at $92. So I’m taking profits.”
NVDA was trading at around $176 as of July 28, while the stock price is $170 as of September 18.
Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Brown Advisory Large-Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
Information Technology was the largest detractor from relative performance during the quarter. The strategy’s underweight to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and not owning Broadcom (AVGO) were the two largest detractors during the period. NVIDIA (NVDA), a market leader in advanced graphics processing units, rebounded after a first quarter marked by a lower gross margin outlook, which was attributed to short-term complexities in ramping up Blackwell production, and a broad-based decline in AI infrastructure stocks. The company’s most recent quarterly earnings were modestly ahead of consensus expectations, and management expects gross margins to increase by year-end as yield and throughput on Blackwell racks continue to improve."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) received an upgrade from Baird on Friday, with analyst Ben Kallo raising the rating to outperform and lifting the price target from $320 to $548.
Kallo said Tesla is increasingly being valued as a physical AI company rather than a traditional carmaker. While recent quarters have shown weak electric vehicle sales, investor focus has shifted to the company's future in robotics and autonomous mobility.
Baird's base scenario is that by 2035, Tesla will have sold 20 million cars, had 10 million active full self-driving subscriptions, deployed one million robotaxis, and sold one million Optimus robots for $20,000 apiece, making a 50% gross profit. If this happens, Baird thinks Tesla's market valuation may go beyond $5.5 trillion, which would mean a share price of nearly $1,412 after accounting for dilution.
In a bullish scenario where Tesla doubles those milestones, the firm projects a market cap of $12 trillion, with the stock potentially trading at $3,043. Kallo emphasized that this is not Baird's base case but illustrates the upside if Tesla scales its AI products.
Tesla shares have gained 22.6% over the past month but were down 2.1% on Thursday. The next catalyst for investors will be Tesla's progress on robotaxi launches and updates on its Optimus program."

(Reuters) -All three of Wall Street's main indexes registered record closing highs for a second straight day on Friday, with trading volume hitting its highest level since April, as FedEx rose after upbeat earnings.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notched their third straight week of gains, boosted by the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of 2025 on Wednesday and indications of further monetary policy easing.
Volume on U.S. exchanges on Friday was 27.78 billion shares, compared with the 17.41 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Trading volume in early April broke U.S. records as the market was whipsawed in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff announcements.
Shares of parcel delivery company FedEx popped 2.3% after it reported quarterly profit and revenue above analyst estimates on Thursday, as cost-cutting and strength in domestic deliveries helped offset weaker international volumes.
Apple rose 3.2% following a price target raise from J.P. Morgan, while gains in Palantir Technologies and Oracle also drove the S&P 500 technology sector up 1.19%.
Seven of the 11 S&P sector indexes rose, while energy stocks were the biggest drag.
Wall Street wavered earlier in the day as investors continued to digest the Fed's outlook and get a read on Stephen Miran, its newest governor and White House economic adviser, who spoke on CNBC on Friday morning.
""Certainly if the idea is the Fed is moving in a direction to relax the inflation target, that is definitely a recipe for running hot, and that's good for stocks,"" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.

For the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Nasdaq climbed 2.2% and the Dow added 1.05%.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index dropped 0.71% after briefly hitting an intraday record high. It notched a record close on Thursday, its first since November 2021.
""Small caps have been trading inversely with rates, and it's just the idea of small caps benefiting disproportionately from lower interest rates,"" Ladner said.

(BAC)strategists.
A BofA team led by Michael Hartnett studied 10 equity bubbles since the start of the previous century, finding that these periods of extreme overvaluation produced average trough-to-peak gains of 244%. That suggests that, after rising 223% from their March 2023 low, the so-called Magnificent Seven cohort has “more to go,” the strategists wrote in a note.

Current valuations also support the notion of further gains for the group, the strategists said. Past stock bubbles typically ended with trailing price-to-earnings ratios of 58, with the benchmark of these stocks 29% above its 200-day moving average.
The seven — Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) — have a trailing P/E ratio of 39 and are still only 20% above their 200-day DMA. This renders them the “best bubble proxy today,” Hartnett and his team wrote.
Appetite among investors for US tech megacaps has driven stocks to all-time highs this year and shows no signs of abating. The Magnificent Seven group recovered swiftly from the shocks caused by the Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek and the turmoil around Trump Administration trade-tariff announcements.
The S&P 500 Info Tech Index has surged 56% from its low in April, with investors buying into every dip along the way.
A positive macro-economic backdrop, the sustained frenzy around AI, along with expectations of further Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts are acting as tailwinds for the sector. In fact, the BofA fund manager survey released this week showed that “Long Magnificent Seven” was regarded as the most crowded trade for the second month running by 42% of respondents.
Hartnett and his team noted that bubbles tend to be short and very concentrated. Back in 2000, as internet-related stocks rallied to extreme levels, the tech sector rose 61% in six months to its peak, while every other S&P 500 sector was down that year.
Meanwhile, investors should also “barbell” their exposure to the Big Tech bubble with some holdings in “distressed value,” as these spurts of hyper-valuation boost economic growth as they unfold. Hartnett said current potential examples of such plays included Brazil, the UK and global energy stocks."

The Japanese electronics company aims to boost battery capacity by 25%, potentially extending Tesla’s Model Y range by around 90 miles (145 km) with the existing battery size.
Panasonic’s new battery could also enable the company to create “lighter” and potentially more affordable batteries by maintaining the current driving range while reducing battery size, according to the news agency’s report.
Ahead of a presentation by Panasonic Energy’s technology leader Shoichiro Watanabe, a company executive revealed details about anode-free battery technology.
This method involves generating a lithium metal anode inside the battery after its first charge, allowing for the inclusion of more active cathode materials like cobalt, aluminium, and nickel, thereby increasing capacity without expanding the battery’s size.

However, the company has not disclosed how this technology might affect production costs or whether it could help reduce Tesla’s vehicle prices.
The news comes at a time when Tesla’s US market share has seen a decline, reaching its lowest point in nearly eight years in August, as consumers opt for EVs from an expanding array of competitors.

Since those highs, however, shares have slowly sunk in value. Today, shares trade below $20 per share.
Why is Lucid stock falling? There's one obvious reason.
Lucid stock popped after its $300 million deal with Uber
On July 17, Lucid Group announced a blockbuster deal with Uber Technologies. The deal called for Uber to invest $300 million into Lucid. In return, Lucid would supply Uber with 20,000 SUVs that would power Uber's fledgling robotaxi division.
At first, the market was exuberant about the news. Tesla had recently launched its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with some analysts believing the service could add $1 trillion to Tesla's market cap by the end of 2026. Others have noted that the global robotaxi market could eventually be worth as much as $10 trillion. Armed with a major partner with a global scale, Lucid's deal with Uber suggested that the company would be a major player in this emerging opportunity. The $300 million cash infusion, meanwhile, was a meaningful addition for an unprofitable company struggling to achieve economies of scale.
Lucid's deal with Uber presented a possible game-changer for the company's long-term prospects. Why, then, did shares cede all of the gains over the following weeks? Perhaps investors had time to digest the true details of the partnership, learning in the process that there are several reasons for concern.
Lucid's deal with Uber isn't as promising as it sounds
Let's look at the financial implications first. On Sept. 4, Lucid announced the closing of Uber's $300 million investment. ""The strategic investment was made as part of the next-generation premium global robotaxi program announced in July,"" the company noted. ""The robotaxi, which will utilize Lucid's electric vehicle technology platform, is planned to be built at Lucid's manufacturing facility in Arizona and will operate exclusively on Uber's ride-hailing platform. The funding supports the partnership between the two companies and contributes to development costs associated with the autonomous robotaxi initiative.""
Here's the problem: Last quarter, Lucid posted a net loss of $539 million. Over the past five years, Lucid has never posted a positive quarterly profit. That's a reasonable situation to be in for a growth company trying to achieve critical scale. But it also puts Uber's $300 million investment into context. That is, Uber's investment won't even cover what Lucid typically loses in a single quarter.
The second area of concern is the timing of the robotaxi business. The deal calls for Lucid to supply 20,000 vehicles to Uber over the next six years. The robotaxi service, meanwhile, isn't supposed to begin until ""late next year."" Put simply, this is not a near-term opportunity for Lucid. Given the company's ongoing net losses, that's a problem. For years, the company has been selling more and more stock to cover its losses, diluting shareholders in the process. The deal's long-term nature does provide upside opportunity. But as the market has shown in recent months, it's reasonable to be skeptical of the timeline. Technology could change in the coming years, prompting Uber to add competing partners. Plus, there's no guarantee that Lucid will maintain the capital power necessary to deliver on its end of the deal.
The final concern is that Lucid itself won't be operating the robotaxi division. That will be wholly owned by Uber. So, while Lucid does have direct exposure to the market, it will act as a supplier, not a primary beneficiary.
In all, Lucid's deal with Uber is undoubtedly exciting, with the potential to change the company's long-term trajectory. But there are many reasons for caution, a reality that forced shares to give up the short-term gains that were realized after the initial announcement."

Cash flow is valuable, but it’s not everything - StockStory helps you identify the companies that truly put it to work. That said, here are two cash-producing companies that excel at turning cash into shareholder value and one that may struggle to keep up.
One Stock to Sell:
Tesla (TSLA)
Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 6%
Originally founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle company accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
Why Is TSLA Risky?
-
Tesla's scale advantage in EV production leads to gross margins that exceed incumbents such as General Motors and Ford. However, a softer macroeconomic backdrop and tariff pressures have weighed on automobile sales, which are highly cyclical.
-
The company's execution ability is a question mark given its long history of delays, such as the Cybertruck and Robotaxi launches. Its sizeable investments in projects with uncertain return timelines, like Optimus, also raise skepticism from investors.
-
On the bright side, Tesla's Megapack product solves a critical problem for utilities needing renewable energy storage solutions. This innovation has made the energy segment the most profitable and fastest-growing business line for the company.
Tesla is trading at $418.05 per share, or 198.1x forward price-to-earnings. To fully understand why you should be careful with TSLA, check out our full research report (it’s free).

DYDX Price Analysis: Can DYDX Push Past the $0.70–$0.72 Resistance Zone?
DYDX traded near $0.69 in the past 24 hours, marking a +5% gain, with price movement ranging between $0.65 and $0.69.
(Source – DYDX USDT, TradingView)
The DYDX/USDT 4-hour chart points to a steady recovery after recent consolidation.
From a mid-September low around $0.60, the token has pushed back above the $0.68 resistance zone, supported by rising trading volumes that signal stronger buyer activity.
On the technical front, DYDX has regained both the 50-period EMA at $0.6418 and the 100-period EMA at $0.6345.
These levels now act as short-term support. A bullish crossover of candles above the moving averages reinforces the case for renewed upside momentum, with volume patterns showing clear accumulation at lower prices.
The structure resembles a bullish continuation setup, with higher lows forming beneath resistance. Immediate pressure is at $0.6880, the zone DYDX is currently testing.

A breakout could pave the way toward the $0.70-$0.72 range, where earlier highs and a psychological barrier align. On the downside, the $0.64-$0.63 area remains key support. A break below this range could drag the price back to $0.60.
Overall, DYDX is flashing early signs of a trend shift after weeks of sideways to bearish action. Sustained strength above $0.68 with firm volume may confirm a breakout rally, while failure to hold that level risks trapping late buyers and triggering a pullback.
Traders are watching closely to see if the token can build a new base higher up the chart.
On the dYdX Chain, derivatives activity stayed steady over the past day. Data from DefiLlama shows 24-hour perpetuals volume between $430M and $440M, with weekly volume near $1.76Bn.
These numbers line up with the broader rise in DeFi derivatives trading, signaling that dYdX is moving in step with the wider market trend.

TAIPEI, Sept. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Tesla and Samsung have struck a US$16.5 billion chip deal seen as a win-win, with Samsung's Texas fab set to produce Tesla's next-gen AI6 chips. Tesla gains customized supply chain support, while Samsung strengthens its foundry credibility and expands its external client base.
Following an announcement by Samsung of a US$16.5 billion foundry deal with an unnamed client, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on social media that Samsung's new Texas fab will produce Tesla's next-gen AI6 chip. Tesla will also aid in enhancing the plant's production efficiency, spotlighting both Tesla's chip plans and Samsung's foundry goals.
Supply chain integration behind Tesla-Samsung partnership
For Tesla, the deal provides not only flexibility, risk diversification, and bargaining power but also benefits from customized cooperation and integrated supply chain support.
Tesla's demand for advanced process chips goes beyond vehicles to include robots and AI applications. Unlike traditional chip designers, Tesla focuses on custom-designed chips optimized for its own products. To realize its vision and stay ahead in AI and ""Physical AI,"" Tesla requires strong manufacturing support and seamless supply chain coordination.
From a supply chain and customization standpoint, Samsung suits Tesla better than TSMC. Tesla's EV sales, under 2 million annually, and the US$16.5 billion AI6 order over several years are modest for TSMC, limiting Tesla's access to tailored services. Samsung, aiming to grow its foundry business, finds Tesla's demand significant enough to warrant adjustments, explaining the focus on the AI6 rather than the AI5.
On another note, Samsung's vertical integration business model means weaker product sales affect its overall revenue; therefore, partnering with Tesla helps bridge this gap, as Tesla's focus on EVs and robotics complements Samsung's main business. Beyond foundry services, Samsung could provide memory, batteries, and displays, boosting Tesla's supply while ensuring demand for Samsung's products.
Building confidence in Samsung's Foundry through Tesla
For Samsung, teaming up with Tesla is less about quick profits and more about boosting its foundry business credibility. DIGITIMES foresees that Samsung and Intel are expected to capture around 10% and 9% of the global foundry market by 2025, mostly driven by internal demand—over 90% for Intel and at least 50% for Samsung. Attracting more external clients is essential for both companies."

-
Elon Musk was the world’s richest person for nearly 300 days before Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison experienced a $101 billion overnight wealth surge, taking the throne from the Tesla executive. But his high was short-lived, as in the days following Oracle’s breakout earnings report, Ellison’s net worth plummeted $34 billion while Musk enjoyed a $35 billion surge. An economist tells Fortune the fall could be caused by “second thoughts” over Oracle’s recent deal with OpenAI.
Elon Musk had steadily held his spot at the top of the billionaires list for nearly a year straight before Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly knocked him from the throne last week. Following better-than-expected quarterly results from the $856 billion software company, Oracle’s shares skyrocketed by 36% on September 10.
That meant a sizable gain for Ellison’s net worth, which is heavily tied to the company.
The 81-year-old entrepreneur co-founder, who currently owns more than 40% of Oracle, subsequently enjoyed a $101 billion surge in wealth overnight, to $393 billion—placing him ahead of Musk’s $385 billion fortune. He joined the likes of Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault as the few members of the ultra-rich club to surpass the Tesla CEO since he took the top spot back in 2021.
But Ellison’s ranking as the world’s richest person was short-lived: His estimated net worth fell by $34 billion in the two days following Oracle’s stock surge, according to Bloomberg’s index. Although he has made some wealth gains since, he still stands at a net loss of $23 billion from his high last Wednesday.
And J. Bradford DeLong, a U.C. Berkeley economist, tells Fortune that the sharp downfall was triggered by “second thoughts” around Oracle’s cloud deal with OpenAI.
‘Second thoughts’ about Oracle’s involvement with AI
On Wednesday last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI had signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over the next five years. It’s one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed—and the markets went crazy. DeLong says that Oracle would profit heavily from the deal, regardless of whether OpenAI becomes the leading AI business-consumer tech company.
“Ellison’s surge is because [of] the market’s perception of Oracle,” DeLong explains, adding that Ellison’s personal stake in the deal helped shift the company from “being irrelevant, to it being a key participant in OpenAI’s forthcoming construction and operation of data centers.”
But then came mounting concerns that the deal could lead to an “AI bubble.” Ellison was able to secure the OpenAI deal thanks to his budding business relationship with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which allowed Oracle to buy a large amount of state-of-the-art GPUs, setting itself up as a key player in the AI industry. Yet analysts quickly warned of the financial risk—Oracle hasn’t proven itself as a top cloud provider, and OpenAI’s $12 billion annualized revenue pales in comparison to the $300 billion deal. Oracle is relying heavily on one customer who may not be able to afford or fully use what they’ve committed to; and since these obligations are promises for future services not yet delivered, the AI company could potentially delay, change, or cancel parts of the deal."

(NASDAQ:TSLA)’s board has repeatedly expressed confidence in the CEO’s ability to steer the company, despite softening demand and competition from Chinese rivals in key markets.
In other related news, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s board has proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for Elon Musk as CEO, which is set to be the largest pay package in history and reflects the billionaire’s hold over the company.
The carmaker’s shares gained 7.36% on September 12 following Denholm’s interview.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Elon Musk says that the future is ""individualized mass transit"" as his tunnel construction and infrastructure enterprise, The Boring Company, inches closer to completing the planned expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop.
Individualized Mass Transit Is The Future, Says Elon Musk
Quoting a post by the Boring Company on the social media platform X on Wednesday, a user on the platform, Austin Vernon, hailed the company's progress as it shared updates on a new tunnel being dug in Las Vegas.
""Boring Company is dangerously close to being able to provide every city dozens of miles of light rail/BRT type capacity with no public money,"" Vernon said in the post, adding that the tunnels would provide faster travel times.

Responding to Vernon's post, Musk said that while he loves trains as a means of transport, ""the future is individualized mass transit with autonomous electric vehicles taking you precisely to your destination."" Musk also highlighted how tunnels facilitate better flow of traffic by addressing choke points.
""You can't have 3D buildings and expect a 2D transport system to be effective! Multiple layers of tunnels enable transport to be 3D too,"" Musk said. He also outlined how pods/cars in vacuum tunnels serve as the ""fastest way to travel long distances.""
The Boring Company's Dubai Plans, $20 Trillion Trans-Atlantic Tunnel
The comments come as the Boring Company, which plans on constructing over 68 miles of tunnels in Las Vegas with over 55 stations planned in the completed Loop, also proposed expanding its presence in the Middle East with a Dubai loop in the pipeline after signing an MoU with the local government in the Emirate."

The price of Oracle stock has since retreated a bit, putting Ellison back in second place. But it's worth asking: Where does Ellison have his roughly $384 billion of net worth invested?
As you can imagine, a person that wealthy would own many assets. And Ellison, now 81, certainly does. They range from planes, yachts and a sailing team to real estate and houses spread around the world. He also owns 98% of Lana'i, the sixth-largest Hawaiian island.
But the bulk of Ellison's fortune is in three publicly traded companies -- software giant Oracle, electric car maker Tesla, and movie-media conglomerate Paramount Skydance (PSKY 0.67%).
Which of those three companies should less wealthy investors (that's everyone on the planet other than Musk) consider investing in?
Let's look at them a bit more closely.
1. Oracle surges
Ellison founded Oracle with two other engineers in 1977, though they first named it Software Development Laboratories. They adopted the Oracle name five years later and the company went public in 1986.
Over ensuing decades, Ellison accumulated enormous numbers of Oracle shares and today owns some 1.16 billion (about 41% of total outstanding). At today's share price of $301, that amounts to stake of about $349 billion.
The reason Oracle's share price surged last week (and briefly made Ellison the world's richest person) was that it reported quarterly results and, with them, the news that its remaining performance obligations -- expected future revenue from signed contracts that has not yet been collected -- surged during the quarter to $455 billion, a jump of 359%.
Multicloud-based revenue from Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon soared more than 1,500% in the quarter.
If you believe that cloud and data centers are going to continue to surge as revenue streams for big tech, Oracle is a great way to play it. The stock isn't exactly cheap relative to earnings -- the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 44 -- but that enormous backlog of business means lots of additional revenue and earnings coming down the pike, so an investment in Oracle at the current price could easily be justified.
2. Tesla fluctuates
Ellison is estimated to own about 45 million shares of Tesla, or 1.4% of the electric vehicle giant, which makes his stake worth about $19.1 billion at today's share price.
Tesla has certainly been a good investment over the years for those investors who bought in early and held on. Six years ago, the stock was at $16 and today, a share goes for more than $425.
But it's also been a roller coaster, as the share price is often closely associated with the company's flamboyant and unpredictable CEO. Thus it has fluctuated wildly in recent years as Musk has been distracted from day-to-day Tesla management by many other interests, from space exploration to buying Twitter to cutting government costs for President Donald Trump. The stock hit a peak in December and then plummeted more than 50% in the following months.
If you want to sleep well at night, you might limit your investment here.
3. Paramount's potential
Finally, Ellison and his family own about 77% of Paramount Skydance, a media conglomerate that was formed in August when Skydance Media, a media firm run by Ellison's son David, acquired Paramount, the legendary Hollywood studio and owner of CBS, among many other properties.
Paramount Skydance has a market cap of about $20 billion, which puts the Ellison family stake at around $16 billion.
Paramount stock languished for years before the merger as the company struggled to compete in a fast-evolving and cutthroat media industry and adapt to new technologies and changing consumer behaviors.
But with the recent merger, Paramount now has an influx of nearly endless money from one of the world's richest families. It also has a close connection to a major tech firm, which is likely to come in handy as technology continues to transform the entertainment industry.
David Ellison is already using his father's fortune to make some bold moves, from a recent $7.7 billion deal for rights to Ultimate Fighting Championship content, to a pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. movie and television studio.
Trading at just 12 times future earnings, Paramount Skydance is a bargain at the moment.
Any media company that wants to survive and thrive in today's fast evolving environment will need lots of funding and technology. That could make this a stock worth putting a few bucks into."

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-18T11:05:00,Where Will Tesla Stock Be in 1 Year?,"Tesla's next year hinges less on car sales and more on whether autonomy turns from promise into a real, profitable network.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a88a28153ba92066a32b6d207667fb7efb7ca65e0b727cf68f91a70dce39da53,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/where-will-tesla-stock-be-in-1-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/where-will-tesla-stock-be-in-1-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/where-will-tesla-stock-be-in-1-year/,fool.com,200,,"Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) is having a volatile year as investors toggle between weak vehicle demand and rising hopes for autonomy. The electric-vehicle pioneer also sells energy storage systems and runs a global charging network, but the story dominating the stock is Tesla's push to commercialize self-driving. Indeed, shares trade around $420 as of this writing, following a sharp rebound in recent sessions that was fueled by renewed optimism around Robotaxis and AI.
The next 12 months won't be decided by a neat model or a single datapoint. If an autonomous ride-sharing network takes hold, it could spark a wave of new orders and a higher-margin services business layered on top of the installed base, justifying Wall Street's recent optimism for the stock. If it doesn't, investors are left with a cyclical auto company investing heavily in ambitious and costly projects. Therefore, the honest answer to ""Where will Tesla be in a year?"" is that the range of outcomes is unusually wide.
Recent results show mixed momentum
Results through June highlight the push-and-pull across Tesla's businesses. In the second quarter of 2025, total revenue fell 12% year over year to $22.5 billion as automotive sales cooled, even as energy storage remained a bright spot.
Margins tell a similar story. Tesla's combined gross margin for its automotive and ""services and other"" segments fell to 15.4% from 17.1% a year ago, reflecting lower prices and less regulatory credit revenue, while energy generation and storage gross margin rose meaningfully to 30.3% from 24.6% on lower unit costs. Operating lines continue to absorb stepped-up spending. Research and development expenses rose sharply as management invests in artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, and an expanded product roadmap, with research and development expenses reaching about 7% of revenue in the quarter versus roughly 4% a year ago.
Helping balance this high spending, liquidity remains a strength. Tesla ended the quarter with $36.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, supported by $4.7 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of 2025. This robust balance sheet gives the company room to invest even when demand is weak.
A wildcard
The swing factor is autonomy. In Tesla's second-quarter 10-Q, management notes, ""the launch of our Robotaxi service in June 2025 will unlock significant business growth to advance a service-driven business model."" Additionally, Tesla says it is building the supporting infrastructure as it scales. A paid pilot program is already running in Austin, and Tesla has publicly framed its upcoming ""Cybercab"" as the purpose-built vehicle for future fleet expansion. Execution here could be transformative -- both by creating a high-margin network service and by pulling through new vehicle demand from customers who want cars that can earn money while they sleep.
But there are material risks over the next 12 months. First, autonomy depends on software progress and regulatory approvals; timelines have slipped before across the industry, and rivals like Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox are also pushing forward, adding competitive pressure and shaping public perception. Second, Tesla's core auto profitability is under strain, so heavy investment in autonomy, new vehicle programs, and humanoid robotics could keep near-term margins soft if demand does not reaccelerate. Notably, deferred revenue tied primarily to Full Self-Driving features rose to $3.75 billion at quarter-end -- a reminder that a portion of the value investors expect still sits in obligations to deliver future capability.
Valuation magnifies the uncertainty. On trailing revenue of roughly $93 billion, the company's market value implies a rich price-to-sales multiple (about 15) for a manufacturer with compressing auto margins -- unless autonomy inflects. If Robotaxi usage expands beyond a limited pilot, Tesla could look more like a networked platform with high incremental margins on software and rides, and the current price may prove reasonable. If Robotaxi traction stalls, investors may reassess how much to pay for a slower-growing auto and energy business -- even with solid cash and a growing energy storage segment.
Stepping back, the most useful way to frame the next year is as a spectrum. At the high end, a scaled autonomous network plus stronger vehicle orders could send earnings and the stock sharply higher. In the middle, modest autonomy progress and a return to moderate growth in vehicle sales could keep shares range-bound as profits recover gradually. At the low end, limited autonomy progress and lingering weak demand could leave margins thin and the stock vulnerable. That is precisely why Tesla remains a speculative bet best suited for investors with large risk appetites: the upside is massive if autonomy works -- and the downside is meaningful if it does not."

The German luxury marque will launch the next-generation CLA sedan with a fully electric version in late 2025, just as EV demand buckles.
The new CLA is more than a makeover. It’s a template for Mercedes’ pragmatic pivot from an EV-only strategy to one with diversified powertrains.
The CLA debuts a platform designed for electric and hybrid powertrains that will underpin several compact and midsize models. Similarly, other Mercedes models will support gasoline-only, hybrid and electric powertrains.
The electric CLA, expected to be priced around $50,000, brings greater affordability to the brand’s EV lineup and positions Mercedes to tap into a market sweet spot that it has ceded to rivals BMW and Tesla.
Mercedes’ U.S. sales chief, Bart Herring, said the CLA creates “an opportunity in the BEV segment to target customers that we haven’t addressed.” He said the goal in part is to attract buyers of the Audi E-tron, BMW i4 and Tesla Model 3.
“We may have lost them three or four years ago, when they made the jump to EVs … because we haven’t had an EV at this price point,” Herring told Automotive News. “Now, we have the chance to bring them back.”
Although Mercedes might now have a competitive product with the nearly 400-mile electric CLA, it doesn’t have timing on its side.
EV demand, already shaky for the past year, is expected to plunge further after the Trump administration ends the federal $7,500 EV tax credit Sept. 30.
Meanwhile, Mercedes will face a 15 percent U.S. tariff on every CLA shipped from its plant in Rastatt, Germany.
Herring acknowledged the industry reality and said he has a plan. It will involve creative pricing and supply discipline to drive consumer interest without decimating profits.
While the electric CLA will be launched nationally, Mercedes will strategically deploy its supply. The automaker will focus on markets friendly to EVs, such as California.
“We look at where we think the market demand is sustained, and that’s where we’re targeting with the right amount of vehicles,” Herring said.
The executive declined to share projected volumes for the electric CLA but said he expects dealerships to have a 45- to 60-day supply.
“We’re careful with supply on these vehicles, knowing there is less room for error, given the tariff and loss of the subsidy,” Herring said.
Pricing pressure from competition
Herring declined to give a price for the electric CLA but said it must be competitive with other cars in its segment, including gasoline-powered models.
“It’s going to be a very different world come Oct. 1, because $7,500 capitalized over a 36-month or even 24-month lease can have a pretty dramatic impact on the payment,” Herring said.
Dealer Garth Blumenthal said Mercedes must “go all-in” on pricing to make the CLA a real contender.
The new CLA has a competitive electric driving range and is larger and more attractively styled than the current generation, said Blumenthal, CEO of Unstoppable Automotive Group, which operates two Mercedes dealerships in California.
“It’s a winner — especially if we get the right payment,” he said.
Noel Preston, Mercedes platform director for Swickard Auto Group, said keeping the monthly lease payment to between $500 and $600 “would be a big win” in driving volume.
“But losing $7,500 is going to make it a lot tougher,” Preston said. “If the government isn’t giving us any money, how much is Mercedes-Benz willing to do?”
Herring said that though losing the tax credit will challenge the industry, it also will reveal genuine demand for EVs.
He sees the CLA as a lower-risk way to test organic EV interest in a world without subsidies before Mercedes launches an electric version of its high-volume GLC crossover in the second half of next year.
“It’s an opportunity to have a really fantastic BEV in the market early and experiment in a way that gives us some great experience,” Herring said.
Tariffs threaten CLA profits
While U.S. tariffs will impact profitability at the point of sale, Herring said Mercedes considers the “lifetime value” of the new customers the electric CLA will attract.
“What’s the service revenue, what’s the opportunity to sell them another car?” Herring said. “Of course, the 15 percent is painful, but … we’re still confident in the opportunity we have with the car.”
Herring declined to reveal Mercedes’ profit outlook for its newest EV.
“We’re not in the practice of selling cars unprofitably,” he said."

Musk said a robotaxi network would make Tesla the most valuable company in the world, and described fleets of autonomous Teslas gradually taking over the world. He unveiled the autonomous ""Cybercab"" at a splashy event last October, and he's proposed that individual Tesla owners would be able to cash in on the emerging technology, renting out their vehicles as autonomous ridesharing vehicles when they're not using them. Tesla backers like Ark Invest's Cathie Wood have argued that robotaxis would send the company's valuation to $5 trillion.
However, since Tesla's launch of a small robotaxi fleet in Austin, which expanded from an initial number of 10 to 20 in June to 30 by late August, Musk has been rather quiet about the new business.
He also made a statement earlier this month that suggests he's more focused on Tesla's next big thing, implying that the hype around robotaxis could be a thing of the past. In a post on his social media platform X, Musk said that ""80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus,"" referring to the company's autonomous robot that's still in development.
It's unclear what timeline Musk has in mind for that, but based on that post, he clearly thinks that Optimus will one day dwarf the value of both Tesla's core EV business and the emerging robotaxi business.
Promises, promises
Even Tesla bulls know by now that Musk's statements are best taken with a grain of salt. It's hard to know if the quote above about Optimus was based on any real forecasting or just on his enthusiasm and confidence in the new technology.
Though it frustrates Musk's critics, part of his talent as a CEO is to perform a sort of sleight-of-hand where he distracts investors from current problems with the company by making promises about the future. Similarly, the bull case for Tesla seems to be constantly changing. At the start of the year, Musk's alliance with President Donald Trump drove the stock to double in price in just a few months before it pulled back on subsequent backlash against Musk and Tesla over Musk's apparent falling out with Trump.
Over the last week, Tesla stock has been rallying again despite reports that its market share in EVs has fallen to its lowest point in the U.S. since 2017, at 38% of total EV sales, showing it may be losing the market it once defined.
Musk's promises around robotics and his recent purchase of $1 billion worth of stock seem to have overcome any doubts (for now) and helped fuel recent gains. Tesla also received permission from Nevada to test its robotaxis in that state.
What's next for Tesla's robotaxis
Musk did promote the robotaxi launch in the company's July earnings call, and noted that it's seeking regulatory clearance in the Bay Area, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada.
He also predicted that Tesla would offer autonomous ride-hailing to half the U.S. population by the end of the year. However, now that it's already September, it seems unlikely that it will happen.
The robotaxi went live in the Bay Area on Sept. 4, though rides will come with a safety driver present, meaning they aren't fully autonomous. Tesla does not yet have the permit to operate autonomous vehicles without a driver.
For now, the market opportunity for robotaxis is massive, but Tesla is far from the only competitor here. Alphabet's Waymo remains the leader here, and other deep-pocketed operators are getting in the mix as Amazon's Zoox just launched in Las Vegas.
At this point, it's too soon to judge the impact the robotaxi will have, but it will almost certainly take longer to move the revenue needle than Musk has forecast. Meanwhile, statements like the one above on Optimus may help pump the stock, but they ultimately do a disservice to investors.
Currently, Tesla trades at a sky-high price-to-earnings ratio close to 200, and analysts expect both revenue and profits to fall this year.
Musk may have more bold predictions up his sleeve, but at some point, Tesla is going to have to back them up with real business results. At its current valuation and trajectory, the risk/reward in Tesla stock doesn't seem worth it."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-18T09:06:00,"Will $50,000 Invested in Tesla Stock Today Make You a Millionaire? Elon Musk's Answer May Shock You.",Elon Musk believes Tesla could be worth much more as it capitalizes on opportunities in autonomous driving and robotics.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b5a1878d8150c44ef5fd87c130eb97503c362578ba5a239895f33b6a138e784f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/50000-invested-in-tesla-stock-make-you-millionaire/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/50000-invested-in-tesla-stock-make-you-millionaire/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/50000-invested-in-tesla-stock-make-you-millionaire/,fool.com,200,,"Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) is currently the ninth-largest company in the world, with a market value of $1.4 trillion. But CEO Elon Musk sees physical artificial intelligence (AI) products like autonomous cars and robots as a tremendous growth opportunity.
He argues Optimus, a humanoid robot, could add as much as $25 trillion to the company's market value. And when autonomous driving technology is factored into the equation, Musk thinks Tesla could be a $30 trillion company at some point in the future.
That may surprise some readers because the largest company in the world is currently worth about $4 trillion. But if Musk is correct, the implied upside for Tesla shareholders is more than 2,000%. That means $50,000 invested in the stock today would eventually be worth more than $1 million.
Here's what investors should know about Tesla.
Tesla's electric vehicle business is stalling
Global electric vehicle sales jumped 35% this year through July, but Tesla reported a decline in automotive revenue during the last three quarters. Dwindling demand is partly due to CEO Elon Musk involving himself in politics, which backfired spectacularly, and partly due to competition. Tesla has an expensive lineup of electric vehicles, and more automakers are bringing appealing alternatives to market.
Those dynamics have caused Tesla to lose substantial market share across China, Europe, and the United States. The company accounted for only 12% of global electric vehicle sales through July, down from 17% in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Chinese automakers BYD and Geely have gained market share, and now rank as the top two electric carmakers worldwide in terms of vehicle volume.
Tesla's autonomous ride-sharing and robotics businesses are ramping up
Tesla recently introduced its first commercial autonomous ride-sharing service in Austin, Texas. The company is also testing robotaxis in the San Francisco Bay Area, and recently received approval to start testing in Nevada. While Tesla trails the market leader Alphabet's Waymo, which already operates in five U.S. markets, it theoretically has an advantage.
Tesla's autonomous driving platform relies solely on computer vision. That strategy is not only less costly that the sensor suite (cameras, lidar, radar) used by Waymo and other autonomous driving companies, but also more scalable. Whereas Waymo maps cities in meticulous detail before opening its ride-sharing service to the public, Tesla's vision-only approach makes city maps unnecessary.
Musk says Tesla will eventually hold at least 90% market share in autonomous ride-sharing because its robotaxis are more cost efficient and can be introduced in new cities with more quickly. He said on the second-quarter earnings call that autonomous ride-sharing could have a ""material impact on our financials around the end of next year.""
Sizing the opportunity is challenging, but most analysts see a large market in the making. Straits Research estimates global ride-sharing sales will surpass $900 billion by 2033. Uber CEO Dana Khosrowshahi says autonomy will unlock a $1 trillion opportunity in the U.S. alone. And Ark Invest says robotaxi revenue will reach $2.6 trillion per year by 2030.
Meanwhile, Tesla is also developing an autonomous humanoid robot called Optimus, which Musk says will eventually be its most valuable product. The company plans to scale production next year and hopes to build at least a million units annually within five years. However, Tesla faces a great deal of competition in that market, especially from Chinese companies.
""China has a commanding lead in physical AI,"" writes Morgan Stanley analysts. But the humanoid market will be large enough to support multiple winners. Global wages total approximately $30 trillion annually, and humanoid robots could curb some of that spending through automation. Morgan Stanley estimates humanoid robot sales will increase at 34% annually to reach $4.7 trillion by 2050.
Tesla is one of the most expensive stocks in the S&P 500
Valuing Tesla is difficult because the electric car business, which currently accounts for three-quarters of total revenue, has lost momentum. The company has pivoted toward AI products, but neither autonomous ride-sharing nor humanoid robots are a material source of revenue today. That means earnings are likely to grow slowly in the near term, but could accelerate a few years out.
Nevertheless, investors should be aware of the current facts and figures. Tesla shares trade at 169 times 2026 earnings, which makes it the third-most expensive stock in the S&P 500. That valuation multiple is particularly pricey for a company whose earnings are forecast to grow at just 19% annually in the next three years.
Here's the bottom line: Tesla's current valuation is unsustainable if the company fails to capitalize on opportunities in robotaxis and robotics. Investors who lack confidence in those endeavors should avoid the stock. But investors who think Tesla can disrupt the mobility and labor markets should own the stock, though I would keep my position small."

(Reuters) - Panasonic aims to develop a new type of higher-capacity battery in about two years, potentially extending the driving range of electric vehicles in a groundbreaking advance for the Tesla supplier.
The Japanese company is working on eliminating the anode in batteries during the manufacturing stage to increase energy density through technology it says is likely to provide a ""world-leading level"" of capacity by the end of 2027.
If achieved, the improvement would lead to a 25% increase in battery capacity, Panasonic said. That would boost the driving range of Tesla’s most affordable sport-utility vehicle, the Model Y, by almost 90 miles (about 145 km), at current battery pack size.
Alternatively, Panasonic could also use the technology to make lighter - and potentially cheaper - versions of batteries by keeping the current driving range and shrinking the battery pack size.
A company executive told reporters of the anode-free technology ahead of a presentation on Thursday by Shoichiro Watanabe, the technology chief at the group's battery arm, Panasonic Energy.
This technology is also being pursued by multiple global battery producers.
Panasonic's proposed design has no anode at the manufacturing stage. Instead, a lithium metal anode is formed in the battery after being charged for the first time. This would free up room for more active cathode materials — nickel, cobalt and aluminium — to boost capacity without changing the volume.
Panasonic said it also aims to reduce the proportion of nickel, which is relatively more expensive.
It was not clear whether the technology would help Tesla to lower prices and Panasonic declined to discuss specifics on manufacturing costs.
Reuters reported this month that Tesla’s U.S. market share dropped to its lowest in almost eight years in August as buyers chose electric vehicles from a growing stable of rivals over the ageing line-up offered by Elon Musk’s company.

The Dawn Project's founder and software expert, Dan O'Dowd, has slammed Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) for redacting its Robotaxi crash reports to the NHTSA. O'Dowd has been a vocal critic of the technology.
Tesla's Supervised Robotaxi Had Three Crashes And An Injury, Says Dan O'Dowd
Taking to the social media platform X on Tuesday, O'Dowd criticized Tesla in a post. ""In one month of operation Tesla's supervised “Robotaxi” had three crashes and injured somebody,"" O'Dowd said in his post, sharing an image of apparent NHTSA crash test reports, which shows the statement, ""Redacted, may contain confidential business information,"" against Tesla's column.
O'Dowd said that Tesla was ""terrified of the public learning how defective its software is,"" adding that it was therefore hiding its reports, unlike ""real robotaxi companies.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Interestingly, below Tesla, reports submitted by Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) autonomous ride-hailing company Waymo are visible in the image shared by O'Dowd.
NHTSA Probe Over Delays
O'Dowd's comments come as the NHTSA had earlier launched a probe into Tesla over delays in submitting crash test reports for the company's FSD and Autopilot software.
""Many of the reports were submitted as part of a single batch, while others were submitted on a rolling basis,"" the agency said. Meanwhile, Tesla said that the delays had occurred due to issues with data collection, which have been fixed, according to the EV giant.
The news comes as Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, recently shared that he was working with various departments within the EV giant, with a particular focus on Tesla's artificial intelligence as well as autopilot capabilities.
Tesla also recently announced the expansion of its Robotaxi service in Austin, which would operate on the highways in the presence of an onboard safety operator now in the driver's seat.
$1 Trillion Opportunity Amid Doubts Over Autonomy, FSD Lawsuits
Amid the autonomous push, Tesla bull Dan Ives recently predicted that autonomous driving and AI present a $1 trillion market opportunity for Tesla, despite doubts expressed by experts like Ross Gerber over Tesla achieving autonomy.
Tesla's FSD also faces lawsuits filed by investors as well as customers over the technology's effectiveness and safety, after the FSD-powered Robotaxi committed possible traffic violations during the Austin Robotaxi launch event in June.

Claiming the top spot in notional short is mainly related to Nvidia’s surging market capitalization, the report highlights.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) maintains its position as the second-largest short position by notional dollar value at $32.7 billion, while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) (NASDAQ:MSFT) has moved into third place at $30.6 billion, the report indicates. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in fourth at $27.7 billion in notional short interest.
The rankings represent a significant shift in market capitalization from the beginning of 2025, when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the group at $3.9 trillion but has since experienced a 9% decline in valuation, dropping it to third place in market capitalization. Nvidia, which was previously tied with Microsoft for second place in market cap, has surged 30% in market cap to claim the top position at $4.3 trillion. Microsoft sits second at $3.8 trillion. Despite this increase, Nvidia’s short interest percentage of float has decreased by 11%, while Microsoft and Tesla have each seen increases of approximately 20% in this metric.
The research highlights notable changes in volatility across these major technology stocks. Tesla has become 22% less volatile, while Nvidia has experienced a 15% volatility decline, contributing to a 25% reduction in its daily risk exposure. Using recent volatility measurements, Nvidia’s volatility has decreased to levels comparable to non-technology stocks.
S3 Partners’ analysis reveals a strong inverse relationship between stock returns and short interest percentage of float across these four companies, which creates a degree of stability in notional calculations by making them less sensitive to volatility in either component.

Riders can initially hail driverless cars through the Waymo app, with plans to integrate the fleet into Lyft’s platform later in 2026.
The collaboration is significant given that Waymo also has deals in place with Lyft's rival Uber (UBER) for its robotaxis in Atlanta and Austin. Uber shares were down about 5% following the announcement on Wednesday morning.
The robotaxi race has accelerated this year. Tesla (TSLA) began testing its service in Austin this summer, with plans to eventually expand to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. Zoox, backed by Amazon (AMZN), also has limited testing in San Francisco and Las Vegas. Waymo has been leading the race, providing paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin.
Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a press release that the deal was part of a gradual rollout as the company continues to scale Waymo's ride-hailing service ""to more people and more places.""
At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently. It could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.
For Lyft, the Waymo partnership could help the company better compete with Uber and Tesla as it sidesteps building the autonomous technology in-house — a costly and risky prospect, particularly if AV expansion stalls.
Still, Lyft faces other challenges. In a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an In Line rating after Lyft's mixed second quarter results, calling the key question ""the company’s ability to sustain top-line growth while ramping profitability.""
""We see LYFT’s valuation as very reasonable,"" Mahaney said. Even so, the firm ""would like to see positive fundamental trends sustained over time to become constructive on the shares.""
Lyft stock is up 70% year to date versus Uber's 48% rise during the same period. Uber's market cap, however, is $195 billion, dwarfing Lyft's $9 billion valuation.

“We were looking into five jurisdictions, and lawyers told me, ‘Yes, you can do it. It will be permissioned with a whitelist,’” Levi recalled. “And I said, ‘No, I’m not interested. I don't want to build it because I will not use it.”
In crypto, whitelists are typically used to grant individuals approval to participate in a specific event, whether that’s minting an NFT or investing in a cryptocurrency’s debut. Within the context of tokenized equities, one could dictate who’s allowed to hold the digital representations of stock.
Backed began issuing tokenized stocks under its xStocks brand in June, and as the company competes with similar offerings from retail brokerage Robinhood and tokenization platform Securitize, Levi argued that a permissionless approach is best for adoption.
“Think about a stablecoin being permissioned,” he said. “No one would use that.”
As of Wednesday, xStocks currently had 30,300 total unique holders, according to a Dune dashboard. Tesla’s associated token was the most popular, with 43,000 tokens tied to $18 million in Tesla shares—which serve as its backing.
That distinction is key. Some forms of tokenized stock are “native,” meaning that they carry the same entitlements that investors receive when purchasing stock through traditional means, but xStocks are essentially a wrapper for tokens that are held off-chain.
It’s similar to how most stablecoins function as an IOU for $1, Levi said. They are not issued by a central bank or government, so they are not dollars themselves. And xStocks can be redeemed for actual shares in a company for a fee.
“Were creating wrappers on top of stocks,” he said. “You’re not holding Tesla—that’s important—but you basically have a right to the economic value of Tesla.”
XStocks aren’t available in the U.S., and the tokens are issued under sweeping legislation passed by the Swiss Parliament in 2020. The legal framework is explicitly “innovation-friendly,” according to a fact sheet published by a Swiss government agency in 2023.
Regulators in the U.S. have raised eyebrows in relation to tokenization this year, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce saying in July that tokenization doesn’t trump existing securities laws. Companies like OpenAI have also denounced tokens tied to them as unauthorized.
Still, Levi thinks xStocks could see real adoption outside of the country, for similar reasons that have pushed people toward products from stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether.
“People around the world started using stablecoins as a way to run from inflation, and I think the same will [happen] for xStocks,” he said. “Bitcoin is very volatile, but if you want to have something that is safe and growing, the S&P 500 is a very good product.”"

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing fresh scrutiny after U.S. auto safety regulators said some Model Y doors may not open properly, leaving parents to smash windows to rescue their kids. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirmed Tuesday it has launched a preliminary probe into about 174,000 vehicles from the 2021 model year.
The agency said it received nine complaints that the electronic exterior door handles failed, likely because of low battery voltage. In four cases, children were stuck in the back seat. While Tesla includes manual release handles, regulators noted young passengers may not be able to reach or understand how to use them.
It's not the first time Tesla's door design has raised alarms. Past accidents and fires have left drivers trapped, sparking lawsuits and criticism that the company hasn't fixed what some call a dangerous flaw. NHTSA said its latest review will look at how serious the risk is and whether Tesla's power supply design is reliable enough.
Despite the headlines, Tesla stock closed up more than 2% at $419.25, still buoyed by Elon Musk's $1 billion share purchase announced a day earlier."

(NASDAQ:TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk had grand ambitions with the launch of the Cybertruck. Expectations have underperformed, but there could be good news with the vehicle expanding to more international markets.
What Happened: Tesla officially launched the Cybertruck in November 2023, and for the first two years, the vehicle was only sold in North America.
The electric vehicle company is now branching out to other parts of the world with the recent launch of the Cybertruck in South Korea and the upcoming launch in the Middle East.
Cybertruck deliveries are set to begin in the United Arab Emirates for reservation holders, with a wider public launch to follow soon.
Tesla said the public launch will be ""in the coming weeks in the Middle East."" The company previously said it would sell the Cybertruck in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in April, as reported by Teslarati.
Consumers in other markets have been hoping for the Cybertruck to be released in additional places, but these are the only countries announced by Tesla to date.
The Cybertrucks sold in the Middle East will be exported from Tesla's Gigafactory Texas, as the company's Berlin and Shanghai Gigafactories, which traditionally export vehicles to the region, do not have dedicated Cybertruck production lines.

Why It's Important: Ahead of the North American launch of the Cybertruck, Tesla highlighted that it had over a million reservations for the vehicle.
Musk highlighted the company's goal of an annual production capacity of 250,000 units per year and a goal of selling hundreds of thousands of units of the electric pickup truck.
The launch of the Cybertruck in North America may have been hurt by a higher price than originally estimated and by a lower range than many wanted or expected. Demand for the vehicle in recent months may also be hurt by the brand damage of Tesla and Musk due to his push into politics.
It will be interesting to see how demand for the Cybertruck develops in South Korea and the Middle East, regions that may not share the negative perceptions of Musk or the waning support seen in North America and Europe.
Musk hinted that a smaller Cybertruck could be launched in the future for international markets that have narrower roads. The recent international launches could be a test of how well the vehicle performs there and whether Tesla needs to make adjustments to the vehicle.
In the United States, Tesla sold 38,965 Cybertrucks in 2024, according to reports. This ranked fifth among all electric vehicles in the country for the year, but was well under estimates. In the first 14 months of availability, around 46,000 Cybertrucks were sold in the United States based on recall data."

When I have bulls on the show, Garrett, um, in part and I ask them why they're constructive on the name still, they'll talk about the core EV business, which still does drive the P&L here and and the new affordable model on the way, and they're clearly confident that's going to be a growth driver. I'm curious to get your perspective on that.
We're still constructive on the story longer term. So to be clear, this is more of a 12-month call. Um that's that's what we base our price targets on. and so our our 12-month price target is $300. and I think, you know, we're seeing all the red flags that would uh suggest a pullback is is coming here. Um, you know, but longer term, we like the fact that they're in the uh sort of the industries of the future, autonomous driving, increasingly in robotics. There's a lot of reasons to be bullish on the stock looking out 5 to 10 years from now. It's just that the near term, I think, you know, analysts have really overestimated the earnings and there's a lack of understanding just how much of an adverse impact that that law is going to have on Tesla's bottom line starting with the third quarter.
Can I ask you about autonomous and AI, which you brought up there. Dan Ives over at Wedbush. Now, he of course, bull of bulls on the name, right? He told his clients, Garrett, Tesla is in pole position to be a clear leader in the autonomous market opportunity. The robo taxis, he says set to scale to 30 to 35 cities in the US over the next year. says we believe the AI future of Tesla is worth $1 trillion dollars to the valuation alone over the next few years. What is your response to Mr. Ives there? You agree with that?
I mean, look, there's a lot of reasons for optimism there. In our view though, full their full self-driving where it is today is not ready for prime time. Um, you know, they're only in Austin in in the Bay area right now. Um, and you can go online, find any number of videos that have been uploaded in recent weeks, uh, where, you know, the the the software is taking a vehicle the wrong way, um into oncoming traffic. It's just not quite ready for prime time. And so I think Tesla's going to continue uh to be careful about rolling this out to other markets until it's proven that it is safe and it is ready for uh for mass adoption. But, you know, the other thing I would say is that uh on Tesla's last earnings call in July, you know, Elon Musk acknowledged uh the possibility of a rough few quarters ahead for the company. We think investors should should take him at his word."

The news comes just one day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an probe into Tesla’s door handles, and one week after a Bloomberg News investigation highlighted multiple instances where owners or passengers were stuck in their cars following a crash.
Von Holzhausen didn’t specify when Tesla made the decision to rethink how its door handles work, according to Bloomberg. China has already been pushing automakers to reconsider the use of fully concealed door handles because of safety concerns, although the country’s top regulator has not taken a final action.
One of the two apparent problems with Tesla’s door handles has been they use electronic locks, which can stop working if they aren’t receiving power from the car’s battery system. The other is that, while Tesla does have manual door releases built into its cars, they are often hard to find and difficult to access.
“The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” von Holzhausen told Bloomberg. “That’s something that we’re working on.”
NHTSA opened its investigation on Tuesday after the agency said it had received nine complaints from Tesla owners who experienced a failure with their door handles. In four of those cases, the safety agency said the owners had to break a window “to regain entry into the vehicle.”
Tesla includes instructions in its owner’s manuals that describe how to use an outside power source to activate dead electronic door locks, as both NHTSA and Bloomberg have noted. But NHTSA noted in its preliminary report that none of the owners who contacted the agency reported seeing low-voltage battery warnings — meaning they likely would not have known what was causing the problem."

Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s longtime design chief, said the company is looking to combine the electronic and manual door-release mechanisms, which are currently in separate locations. He said the decision is intended to make the handles more intuitive for occupants in “a panic situation.”
“The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” he said Wednesday in an interview for Bloomberg’s podcast. “That’s something that we’re working on.”
Tesla’s handles have drawn attention after a Bloomberg News investigation this month uncovered a series of incidents in which people were injured or died after they were unable to open doors after a loss of power, particularly after crashes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received more than 140 consumer complaints related to doors on various Tesla models getting stuck, not opening or otherwise malfunctioning since 2018, Bloomberg found.
NHTSA, the US auto safety regulator, this week opened an investigation into whether some Tesla doors are defective, citing incidents in which exterior handles stopped working and trapped children inside. The probe, which covers an estimated 174,290 Model Y SUVs from the 2021 model year, “will also assess the approach used by Tesla to supply power to the door locks and the reliability of the applicable power supplies,” the agency said.
Von Holzhausen didn’t specify what prompted the company to explore a redesign. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for further comment.
Teslas fare well in government-administered crash tests, but most tests are designed to measure impact survivability and not whether occupants can get out of the vehicle afterward. In China, a top regulator is reportedly considering a ban on fully concealed door handles, and Europe has implemented incremental measures to improve post-crash rescue protocols.
Tesla is currently studying details of the potential change in China, von Holzhausen said, and is ready to make necessary changes.
“We’ll have a really good solution for that,” he said.

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-17T19:38:13,The iPhone Air’s real breakthrough is its battery,"Apple's slimmest iPhone uses a ""revolutionary"" battery design that allows the cell to fill more space within the device, boosting overall energy storage.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e3457a72d17e54d4e0d054060ca5694d065ccaffbf6bcfd8932bff62a5580733,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-air-real-breakthrough-battery-183813418.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-air-real-breakthrough-battery-183813418.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iphone-air-real-breakthrough-battery-183813418.html,yahoo.com,200,,"The iPhone Air’s thin design might be eye catching, and the amount of engineering that went into miniaturizing its logic board is impressive. But according to Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO of battery materials manufacturer Sila, the real breakthrough might lurk elsewhere inside the aluminum and glass enclosure.
“The battery in the new iPhone is pretty remarkable,” Berdichevsky told TechCrunch. “The completely arbitrary, two-dimensional shape — you look at the shape, and it’s pretty amazing.”
“I just got back from Asia and, and I got a chance to see some of these cells,” he added. “It’s a revolutionary piece of battery tech.”
Berdichevsky knows a thing or two about batteries. As Tesla’s seventh employee, he led engineering on the original Roadster’s battery, which became the template for subsequent Teslas. Today, he leads Sila, which is producing silicon anode materials for consumer electronics and, soon, electric vehicles.
The iPhone Air’s notched design is made possible by a technology Apple has patented called a metal can battery. The key detail is in the name: a metal casing that surrounds the entire cell, adding strength and physical durability. Most batteries used in consumer electronics are pouch cells, which have a soft plastic casing that’s cheap to manufacture and allows for some degree of swelling.
Apple has used L-shaped batteries in iPhones for years. All lithium ion batteries swell to some degree, and the interior corner of the L becomes a pinch points when that swelling occurs.
“Those are very finicky, and this basically makes it bulletproof. You can now build batteries in any two-dimensional shape you want,” Berdichevsky said.
Metal can batteries allow Apple to make the most of the small space within the iPhone Air. “They’re able get very close to the edges,” he said. It allows the battery to worm its way into whatever space is free after the various circuit boards have been positioned.
Ultimately, Berdichevsky thinks that most phones will adopt metal can batteries despite their added expense. The extra energy storage will be worth it.
It will also be “very key” for smaller devices like AR and VR glasses, he said, adding that he saw a few prototypes while he was in China. “It’s even more of an energy density improvement because it lets you fit into weird shapes,” Berdichevsky said.
The switch to such a complex battery is likely why Apple hasn’t swapped carbon anodes in its lithium ion batteries for silicon-heavy versions, also known as silicon-carbon.
“If you’re bringing [a new battery design] online, you kind of go, ‘You know what? Let’s use yesterday’s chemistry,’” Berdichevsky said."

According to the investment bank, Tesla will deliver an estimated 465,000 vehicles in the third quarter, which is significantly higher than the consensus estimate of around 430,000 units.
It further stated that Tesla’s inventory will decline by 20,000 units’ quarter-over-quarter. This will bring the company’s total inventory down to an estimated 110,000-120,000 vehicles.

The firm has credited these better-than-expected deliveries to solid data points throughout the quarter and accelerated US sales ahead of forthcoming expiration of the federal electric vehicle tax credit.
However, it has cautioned that despite of near-term delivery strength, investors may be focused on weaker expected volume outlook in Q4 and beyond, especially in the U.S. market where EV demand may witness a major decline after the tax credit expires.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk reiterates his commitment to the EV giant and his other ventures amid TSLA stock rally fueled further by his $1 billion share purchase.
Elon Musk Shares Busy Schedule
A user, Greggertruck, took to the social media platform X on Monday, hailing Musk and Tesla's recent stock rally that saw the share price cross the $400 mark on the NASDAQ.

The billionaire responded to the post by saying, ""Daddy is very much home."" Musk then said that he was ""burning the midnight oil"" working with the Optimus engineering team before arriving in Austin at 5 AM via a ""redeye"" flight on Saturday.
The CEO also said he spent ""all Saturday afternoon in deep technical reviews for the Tesla AI5 chip design,"" adding that he then flew to Memphis to review the ""excellent progress"" on the Colossus II data center.
Following the data center visit, Musk said he then spent 12 hours attending back-to-back meetings with Tesla departments, with ""particular focus on AI/Autopilot, Optimus production plans and vehicle production/delivery.""
Musk's post comes as Wedbush Securities' investor Dan Ives recently said that the billionaire was in ""Wartime CEO mode"" in a new investor's note released over the weekend. Ives also said that autonomous driving, as well as artificial intelligence, presented a $1 trillion market opportunity for Tesla.
However, the recently announced billion-dollar buy has also been criticized by experts like Gerber Kawasaki's co-founder Ross Gerber, who slammed Musk by saying that he should buy another 12% equity in Tesla instead of ""taking it from shareholders.""
Tesla Discontinues Cybertruck, Gigafactory Berlin Announces Production Boost
Meanwhile, Tesla has discontinued the most affordable trim of the Cybertruck, which retailed for $69,990 and boasted more range and fewer features when compared to the Standard and the Cyberbeast trim levels. The move could be a result of poor sales figures currently plaguing Tesla.
However, in a move that could go against sales data, which illustrates the EV giant's lackluster performance in getting cars off the showroom lots, the Gigafactory in Berlin announced it was scaling up production in Q3 and Q4 as it anticipated increased demand after receiving ""positive signals"" from the markets it served.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold
For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides asimple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets."

As of 11:22 a.m. ET, Lyft stock was up 12.2% on the news.
Lyft scores a win
The stakes are getting higher in the autonomous ride-sharing race, as Tesla has started an autonomous vehicle service in Austin and is looking to expand it to other cities. Amazon, meanwhile, launched its Zoox autonomous shuttle in Las Vegas. However, Waymo remains the clear leader in the category.
On Wednesday, Lyft announced a new partnership to bring Waymo's full autonomous ride-sharing service to Nashville in 2026. The new collaboration will take advantage of Lyft's integrated fleet management services through its Flexdrive subsidiary, which handles fleet management services, such as vehicle maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations.
According to the terms of the deal, Waymo's vehicles will first be available on the Waymo app and then added to the Lyft app later in the year.
CEO David Risher said in a press release: ""Waymo has proven that its autonomous technology works at scale. When combined with Lyft's customer obsession and world-class fleet management capabilities, it's two great tastes that go great together.""
What it means for Lyft
It's unclear where this partnership goes from here, and it likely depends on how the Nashville rollout goes. However, it's clearly a win to form a partnership with the leading autonomous vehicle company, and the market response was strong enough that Uber, which has also teamed up with Waymo, fell several points on the news.
It's the latest evidence that Lyft is a much stronger business than it was a year or two ago."

“This is the biggest meme stock we’ve ever seen. Even at its peak, Amazon was nowhere near this level. The PE on this, well above 200, is just crazy. When you’ve got stocks like Nvidia, the price-earnings ratio is around 25 or 30, and Apple is maybe 35 or 36, Microsoft around the same. I mean, this is way out of line to be at a 220 PE. It’s crazy, and they’ve, I think, put a little too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk.”

Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.
Blue Bird has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that BLBD likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TSLA has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.
BLBD currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.34, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 254.34. We also note that BLBD has a PEG ratio of 1.57. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 10.63.
Another notable valuation metric for BLBD is its P/B ratio of 8.24. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 17.43.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BLBD's Value grade of B and TSLA's Value grade of D.
BLBD sticks out from TSLA in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that BLBD is the better option right now.

Riders can initially hail driverless cars through the Waymo app, with plans to integrate the fleet into Lyft’s platform later in 2026.
The collaboration is significant given that Waymo also has deals in place with Lyft's rival Uber (UBER) for its robotaxis in Atlanta and Austin. Uber shares were down about 5% following the announcement on Wednesday morning.
The robotaxi race has accelerated this year. Tesla (TSLA) began testing its service in Austin this summer, with plans to eventually expand to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. Zoox, backed by Amazon (AMZN), also has limited testing in San Francisco and Las Vegas. Waymo has been leading the race, providing paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin.
Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a press release that the deal was part of a gradual rollout as the company continues to scale Waymo's ride-hailing service ""to more people and more places.""
At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently. It could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.
For Lyft, the Waymo partnership could help the company better compete with Uber and Tesla as it sidesteps building the autonomous technology in-house — a costly and risky prospect, particularly if AV expansion stalls.
Still, Lyft faces other challenges. In a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an In Line rating after Lyft's mixed second quarter results, calling the key question ""the company’s ability to sustain top-line growth while ramping profitability.""
""We see LYFT’s valuation as very reasonable,"" Mahaney said. Even so, the firm ""would like to see positive fundamental trends sustained over time to become constructive on the shares.""
Lyft stock is up 70% year to date versus Uber's 48% rise during the same period. Uber's market cap, however, is $195 billion, dwarfing Lyft's $9 billion valuation.

Retail investors cheered it as a vote of confidence, sending the stock up about 4% to cross the $400 mark. The rally continued yesterday, fueled by Musk’s cheeky post on X: “Daddy is very much home.”
But here’s the question— are investors reading too much into Musk’s billion-dollar buy? What has really changed fundamentally for Tesla? Yes, critics argued Musk was stretched too thin, and his divided attention hurt Tesla. But hasn’t much of that damage already been done?
Tesla’s core electric vehicle (EV) business is struggling. The company is now pivoting big into artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving and robotics. Indeed, these are bold plans but also early bets that may take years to pay off. If Musk succeeds, those who ignored his conviction might regret it. Still, is now the right time to double down on Tesla stock just because Musk is? Let’s discuss.
TSLA Making Serious Attempts to Rekindle Investor Confidence
Earlier this month, Tesla unveiled its Master Plan Part IV, doubling down on the familiar buzzwords: AI, robotics, large-scale autonomy, and energy. Musk has been talking about these themes for years, and this latest plan felt more like old promises in a shiny new box than a fresh strategy. (Tesla Master Plan IV: Does It Really Change TSLA's Investment Case?)
Not long after, Tesla proposed a historic new pay package for Musk— a jaw-dropping $975 billion stock award tied to ambitious milestones. To unlock the full payout, Tesla would need to deliver on these goals— boosting adjusted EBITDA 25-fold to $400 billion by 2035, hitting a market value of $8.5 trillion (from just over $1.3 trillion today). Additionally, it will have to sell 20 million vehicles by 2035, add 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, deploy 1 million robotaxis and deliver 1 million humanoid robots. (Can Musk's $1T Pay Package Keep Tesla on the Fast Track?)
It’s bold, no doubt. The board is essentially betting that Musk’s leadership is the only way Tesla can successfully pivot into AI, autonomous vehicles and robotics. His recent $1 billion share purchase only adds to that narrative of commitment.
While these moves send positive signals, they also smack of desperation. Tesla has had a rough start to the year, with rising headwinds and a brand that no longer commands the same magic it once did. These big announcements— whether the Master Plan or Musk’s oversized pay package—seem aimed as much at shoring up investor sentiment as at laying a practical roadmap."

Shares trade at a price to sales ratio of 6. Fellow electric car stock Rivian, for comparison, trades at just 3 times sales -- a 50% discount.
Lucid stock is cheaper than it appears, however. But is it cheap enough to attract growth investors looking for maximum gains? Let's find out.
Lucid is growing much faster than Rivian and Tesla
Stocks trade at different valuations for many reasons. One of the biggest factors is growth expectations. How much the market believes a company will grow sales over the next few quarters and years has a big impact on valuation multiples.
This fiscal year, analysts expect Lucid to grow sales by around 62%. Rivian, meanwhile, is expected to grow sales by just 6.2%. Tesla, on the other hand, is expected to see its sales base shrink by around 5%. Given these expectations, Lucid's valuation suddenly becomes much more reasonable. When you look at the company's forward price to sales ratio -- that is, what its price to sales ratio should be based on expected sales growth -- shares trade at just 4.3 times revenue. That's a notable discount to Tesla's 12 times revenue valuation multiple, and only a slight premium to Rivian's 3.2 times revenue multiple.
RIVN Revenue Growth Estimate for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
Of course, valuation multiples don't just include growth expectations for the next fiscal year. They also factor in longer term growth expectations. This is one reason why Tesla shares retain their premium valuation multiples despite sluggish near term growth forecasts. Some experts, for example, believe that the global robotaxi market will someday be worth up to $10 trillion. After more than a decade of investment, Tesla launched a pilot version of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, believes this division alone could soon add $1 trillion to Tesla's market cap.
So far, Rivian hasn't revealed much regarding its potential robotaxi plans. But Lucid unveiled a major partnership with Uber Technologies this summer. The deal calls for Uber to invest $300 million into Lucid's business, plus a large order of Lucid's vehicles that will eventually power Uber's self-driving taxi service.
Tesla has a big lead in this department. It will wholly own its self-driving taxi business, while Lucid will simply supply Uber with the necessary vehicles. But Lucid's exposure to this multi-trillion dollar opportunity could give it a higher long term growth ceiling. The issue will be timing and capital.
Last quarter, Lucid posted a net loss of $539 million. Uber's robotaxi service, meanwhile, won't start until late 2026 at the earliest, with Lucid's contract spanning six years. The $300 million investment by Uber, therefore, fails to cover even a single quarter's losses for Lucid, with additional revenue opportunities from the deal potentially many years away. So Lucid shares are cheaper than the appear at first glance, but there are many credible reasons for the remaining discount.
Smaller EV stocks like Lucid have more room for growth
Lucid has higher growth expectations for this fiscal year. It arguably has a higher growth ceiling than Rivian, too, considering its robotaxi exposure. But the company has another advantage that neither Rivian nor Tesla have: a market cap under $6 billion, with a sales base under $1 billion.
Typically, smaller companies have an easier time garnering a high valuation multiple. After all, it's easier to double in size as a $5 billion business than as a $500 billion business. Lucid is by far the smallest EV maker when compared to Rivian and Tesla. Its sales would have to grow five times in value to reach Rivian's current sales base. It would then need to grow another 18 times in value to reach Tesla's sales base.
RIVN Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
Put simply, Lucid's small size gives its a longer potential runway for growth than Tesla and Rivian. But there are several critical risks to be aware of with Lucid. Both Rivian and Tesla are better financed -- a huge advantage in a capital intensive industry. Plus, Lucid's longtime CEO left the company earlier this year, adding uncertainty to the company's growth timeline. And while the deal with Uber provides excitement, the actual financial impact may be limited, especially over the short term.
Lucid stock is cheaper than at first glance. But the overall execution risks should keep most investors on the sidelines."

“Humanoid body stocks gained the most, rising 15.7%. We think recent updates on Tesla Optimus have been the key catalyst,” the analysts wrote.
Morgan Stanley highlighted several high-profile Tesla updates that have fueled investor enthusiasm.
The analysts highlighted that on September 5, Tesla proposed a long-term compensation package for CEO Elon Musk tied to a key operational milestone of delivering 1 million bots within 10 years.
Furthermore, on September 7, Tesla shared a Gen2.5 Optimus image on Weibo captioned “accelerating evolution,” while on September 10, Musk revealed at the All-In Summit that Optimus Gen3’s design is being finalized, with hand dexterity comparable to a human.
More recently, on September 16, Musk announced meetings at Tesla focused on Optimus production plans, AI/autopilot, and vehicle output.
Morgan Stanley also noted developments from other players in the space. “FigureAI signaled it has three big announcements to be made in coming 3 days, according to CEO Brett Adcock’s post on X,” the analysts said. They added that in China, key integrators are reporting additional ToB orders totaling nearly Rmb1 billion so far.
Looking ahead, Morgan Stanley expects momentum to persist. “We expect the positive momentum to continue, driven by updates on Optimus Gen3, FigureAI, Unitree IPO progress, key integrators’ investor days, etc. And, we still expect more new order announcements ahead.”
However, the analysts warned of potential downside. “If Optimus production plans or FigureAI announcements disappoint, we see the risk of a sector pullback,” they said, highlighting the need for investors to monitor upcoming catalysts closely.

NIO has started sending its third-generation ES8 electric SUVs to delivery centers across China ahead of the official Sept. 20 launch. Photos shared on Monday showed the new crossovers being loaded onto car carriers at the Hefei factory, confirming that nationwide deliveries will begin right after the sales go live.
Pre-sales of the three-row ES8 began on Aug. 21, and early demand appears strong, with pre-orders surpassing those of NIO’s ONVO L90 model, as confirmed by NIO President Qin Lihong.
The new ES8 is designed for those seeking a high-end experience. Prices range from 416,800 to 456,000 yuan (roughly $58,500–$64,110), but with NIO’s Battery-as-a-Service option, the entry-level trim can be purchased for 308,800 yuan ($43,340). This is a notable shift from the second-generation ES8, which started at 518,000 yuan ($72,820), making the new model way affordable than its predecessor while retaining its premium feel.
The ES8 model comes standard with a dual-motor 4WD setup producing 520 kW (697 hp) and 700 Nm of torque, allowing the SUV to sprint to 100 km/h in just four seconds. A 102-kWh battery pack offers a CLTC range of 635 km, consuming 16.6 kWh per 100 km. The vehicle also includes advanced technology, such as a LiDAR sensor and two roof-mounted cameras, across all trims.
The ES8 is expected to give a significant boost to NIO’s brand sales and reinforce its position in the increasingly competitive EV market. NIO is targeting roughly a 20% gross margin on the ES8, supported by in-house innovation and tight cost control. The fourth quarter will mark the first full quarter of ES8 sales, with the company aiming to deliver 50,000 vehicles across each of its brands — NIO, ONVO and Firefly.
Competitor Check
Tesla TSLA and Li Auto LI are set to give NIO’s ES8 strong competition, both offering six-seat layouts and competitive pricing.
Tesla’s Model Y L in China is a long-wheelbase, six-seat version of its popular SUV. The “L” adds extra legroom, making it more family-friendly. Tesla priced the Model Y L at 339,000 yuan, below the 400,000 yuan many had expected for the extended model.
Meanwhile, Li Auto introduced its Li i8 in late July, another six-seat family SUV. The Li i8 blends off-road capability, sedan-like handling and MPV-level comfort, targeting buyers who want versatility without compromising on luxury or performance. It is available in three trims — Pro, Max, and Ultra — priced at 321,800, 349,800, and 369,800 yuan, respectively.
NIO’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates
Shares of NIO have surged over 60% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 5%."

The Redditor said he kept slowly adding to his Nvidia stake over the next couple of years, and by 2019, he owned about 6,000 shares of the company. In 2019 and 2020, the investor began to feel that Nvidia GPUs were not as closely tied to the crypto industry as once thought. However, there was a new reason for him to keep holding Nvidia in his portfolio.
""The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs,"" he said. ""So my mentality moved from crypto to electric vehicles.""

(Reuters) -Alphabet’s Waymo plans to start offering autonomous cab rides in Nashville next year in collaboration with ride-hailing firm Lyft, the two companies said.
Riders in the Music City will initially be able to hail self-driving cabs through the Waymo app. As the service grows, riders will also be able to use the Lyft app to match with a Waymo vehicle, the companies said in a statement.
As part of the agreement, Lyft will invest an undisclosed sum in an autonomous vehicle fleet-management facility, where it will charge and maintain Waymo vehicles. Lyft’s services should maximize the time Waymo’s vehicles are in operation and reduce costs, the two companies said.
It would be the first commercial deployment of Waymo's driverless taxis on the Lyft ride-hailing network. Waymo already offers rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta through the Uber app.
Waymo’s fleet in Nashville is expected to grow to hundreds of vehicles over time, according to the company.
Waymo has been ramping up operations in the U.S. as the robotaxi race heats up. Tesla deployed a limited robotaxi service in Austin in June. The electric-vehicle company has said it plans to expand the service to the San Francisco Bay Area.
After starting in Phoenix in 2020, Waymo now offers paid driverless rides to the general public in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with parts of Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.
In addition to Nashville, the company has plans to expand operations to Miami, Washington, D.C., Dallas and Denver. It also recently received a permit to begin testing its autonomous vehicles in New York City with a trained specialist behind the wheel.

The Grünheide factory, which first opened in March 2022, serves not just Europe but also Canada, New Zealand, Australia and parts of the Middle East. Earlier this year, the plant rolled out its 500,000th Model Y. Last month, it celebrated another milestone with the production of its 100,000th refreshed Model Y. These underscore how quickly Giga Berlin has scaled since its opening three years ago.
Production Goals Raised Amid Mixed Sales Trends
According to André Thierig, manager of the Berlin facility, the company has revised its production targets upward for the third and fourth quarters, citing “very good sales figures.” He told DPA (the European news agency), as reported by Reuters, that positive demand signals are coming from more than 30 markets that Giga Berlin supplies.
The timing of this optimism is noteworthy as Tesla has been grappling with declining registrations across several European markets this year. Tesla’s European sales slipped for the eighth consecutive month in August 2025, with sharp year-over-year drops in various key markets.
Per Reuters, registrations fell 47% year over year in France last month, over 80% in Sweden, and around 50% in the Netherlands. Germany is also showing signs of weakness. These declines come amid intensifying competition from Chinese automakers, Tesla’s relatively narrow product lineup and public backlash against CEO Elon Musk.
Yet there are a few bright spots. Tesla’s sales in Norway were up 21% last month. Portugal posted nearly 29% growth after months of decline, while Spain recorded a massive 161% jump in sales, aided by government subsidies of up to €7,000. These mixed results suggest that while Tesla’s growth story in Europe has become more complex, opportunities remain in select markets.
Why Giga Berlin Matters
The Berlin factory is no longer just a European production hub. It will also help the company to sidestep tariffs on U.S.-built EVs. Tesla has started routing some vehicles from Germany to Canada, per Drive Tesla. This shift allows the company to cut costs tied to cross-border trade.
Another layer to Berlin’s importance is product exclusivity. At the moment, it is the only Tesla site building the upgraded Model Y Performance. This variant is not just limited to Europe; it’s also heading to the Middle East, and more recently to Australia and New Zealand.

beyond the reach of conventional LDES
TUCSON, Ariz., Sept. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The BESSt Company, founded by Tesla alum Joley Michaelson, has launched a proprietary zinc-polyiodide REDOX flow battery designed for sectors that demand uninterrupted power, data centers, cold storage, and AI infrastructure. Based on breakthrough chemistry licensed from Battelle, The BESSt Company's platform offers multi-hour to multi-day energy storage, safety, affordability, and supply chain resilience, with non-flammable, abundant, rare-earth-free materials, and the most compact footprint in its class. Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is crucial to advancing the energy transition and meeting rising power demand. The BESSt Company's ""any-duration"" storage technology delivers uninterrupted, always-on energy that makes long-duration runtimes viable for sites of any scale.
The Technology and Why It Matters
As power and energy demand surge, extreme weather-related outages increase, and the grid ages out of reliability, critical industries are turning to renewables for an unimpaired and robust energy supply. But generation alone doesn't ensure availability. Many rely on costly workarounds: oversized systems, diesel generators, or short-duration lithium-ion batteries packed with rare earth minerals, limited in capacity, and exposed to fragile supply chains. None were built for extended or bespoke runtimes. To date, most LDES technologies remain too bulky, site-restricted, or capital-intensive for widespread commercial and industrial use.
The BESSt Company battery changes the equation. It aligns renewable generation with real-world usage, turning intermittent power into a stable, on-demand resource. Power is banked, dispatched, and controlled.
""Energy storage has always been the missing link,"" said Joley Michaelson, founder and CEO of The BESSt Company. ""Conventional lithium-ion can't meet today's uptime demands, and most long-duration systems are built for utility-scale projects, not the space and retrofit limits of real-world infrastructure. We designed this battery for those conditions at a cost that makes widespread deployment possible.""
Supported by over 100 peer-reviewed studies and independently validated by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the chemistry offers unmatched safety, lifespan, and operational flexibility.
""It solves the problems that have held long-duration storage back,"" said Kevin Meagher, Chief Science Officer at The BESSt Company. ""We built a system that stores power for days without performance loss, operates reliably in extreme conditions, and delivers predictable output when the grid can't. That's what the market needs: storage that behaves like true infrastructure."""

What Wall Street Has Been Saying
Recent analyst commentary on Samsung Electronics reflects a broadly optimistic outlook, though important reservations remain. The company’s recent strategic wins and sector positioning continue to spark strong opinions from both bullish and cautious voices on the Street.
🐂 Bullish Takeaways
-
Analysts see the $16.5 billion Tesla contract win as a game changer for Samsung’s Foundry division. This is expected to boost utilization rates and support a robust pipeline for future large-scale contracts.
-
The start of a strong and potentially sustainable DRAM upcycle positions Samsung as a primary beneficiary, giving it outperformance potential through 2026.
-
Execution in cost control, operational transparency, and momentum in both memory and foundry segments are consistently highlighted as core strengths that underpin bullish price targets.
-
Deutsche Securities raised their price target to ₩92,000 in the latest report, citing compelling growth prospects in cyclical memory markets and successful Foundry customer expansion. They also noted that higher valuation multiples may already reflect some upside.
🐻 Bearish Takeaways
-
Some analysts maintain a cautious outlook due to muted smartphone growth forecasts from 2025 to 2027. They cite weak innovation, persistently high Android inventory, economic headwinds, and reduced device subsidies in China.
-
Expectations that U.S. tariff-driven demand will pull forward sales are raising concerns about a potential downturn in the second half of 2025, particularly for Samsung’s handset segment.
-
Morgan Lakes reiterated a ""hold"" rating and kept their price target at ₩80,000, underscoring that near-term upside may be limited by elevated valuation and persistent market risks.
-
Bearish analysts also warn that despite strong showings in memory and foundry, broader macro volatility could challenge Samsung’s ability to consistently deliver outperformance, especially if smartphone recovery falters.

The stock popped in response to a highly ambitious five-year roadmap to grow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) from around $10 billion in annual revenue to a staggering $144 billion.
If Oracle achieves this goal, OCI will surpass the current size of the leading three cloud giants by revenue -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.
On Thursday, a 6.2% decline in Oracle, paired with a 6% jump in Tesla, led to Ellison slipping $1 billion below Elon Musk on the billionaire leaderboard, according to Bloomberg. Regardless, Ellison is now in a virtual tie with Musk as the richest person in the world because of his massive stake in Oracle.
Here's why Ellison's ownership of Oracle is great news for long-term investors, and whether the growth stock is a buy now.
The billionaire throughline
A common theme among the world's richest people is that the primary source of their wealth is existing ownership in one company. With the exception of the three Walton children, who inherited large stakes in Walmart, the other nine people on the list of the 10 richest billionaires all played pivotal roles in growing a business, and still hold meaningful positions in those businesses.

Ellison is unique because he owns such a massive amount of Oracle, whereas other founders have decreased positions in their businesses over time. So even though Oracle isn't worth as much as other ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, or Nvidia, Ellison's massive stake can put a charge in his net worth when Oracle soars.
From a legacy stalwart to a cutting-edge AI play
Founder-led companies can be especially effective in the ever-changing technology sector. Ellison's large ownership stake and role as CTO make him heavily involved in Oracle's strategic direction.
Oracle has completely transformed its business model from a large database infrastructure and enterprise software model to a cloud computing giant. To pull it off, Oracle has had to invest a ton of capital, and fast, as the cloud computing race is highly competitive. Its capital expenditures (capex) have exploded higher -- outpacing revenue and earnings growth. So Oracle has taken on a considerable amount of debt to foot the bill.
Oracle is spending so much so quickly that its capex is now higher than its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Most of its capex is going toward building data centers. It's worth noting that capex doesn't even factor into Oracle's operating expenses with its existing businesses. This illustrates the extent of Oracle's leverage.
Oracle's spending is sky high and adds a considerable amount of risk to Oracle's investment thesis. With so much skin in the game, Ellison clearly saw this move as the right one for the long-term growth of the company. Ellison co-founded the company nearly 50 years ago in the late 1970s. So in this vein, Ellison's position is like Bill Gates still being a part of the top brass at Microsoft and having a massive stake in the company.
Oracle still has room to run
Ellison isn't calling all the shots at Oracle, but his large stake gives the company a level of credibility and a vote of confidence for individual investors interested in buying or holding the stock. If Ellison is putting his chips on the table and taking this big bet on cloud, then he must really believe it's the right long-term move, even if it takes a sledgehammer to Oracle's balance sheet and cash flow in the near term.
Wall Street was around. Oracle has nearly doubled in the last year and is up over 300% in the last three years. Investors often prefer capital-light, high-margin business models like those of Nvidia and Apple. Both companies design their products and outsource manufacturing, leading to high margins. But in Oracle's case, its capital-intensive strategy is a strength, as it is at the cutting edge of the future of hyper-efficient cloud computing.
Oracle isn't cheap by any means, but the stock could still be a good long-term investment for risk-tolerant investors seeking innovative companies where founders still have substantial financial incentives to make growth investments pay off."

UBS analyst Paul Gong said Nio’s “latest products could further attract consumers after the US$1bn equity offerings strengthened visibility on its healthy operations.”
Nio’s jump by over 8% on Tuesday propelled the stock to its highest level since last October. The company has also benefitted from optimism around its new model.

Microsoft (MSFT)
Shares in Microsoft moved higher ahead of the US opening bell as it announced a $30bn (£22bn) AI push in the UK.
Microsoft’s investment, the largest ever made by the company in the UK, will fund an expansion of Britain’s AI infrastructure, which Labour sees as a key part of its efforts to secure economic growth, and the construction of the country’s largest AI supercomputer.
Brad Smith, vice chairman and president of the firm, said it had “many conversations” with the UK government, including No 10, “every month”, adding that the investment would have been “inconceivable because of the regulatory climate” in previous years.
“You don’t spend £22bn unless you have confidence in where the country, the government and the market are all going,” he said. “And this reflects that level of confidence.”
Microsoft is backing tech firm Nscale to contribute towards developing a major data centre in the UK, which the company said would help build out Britain’s cloud and AI infrastructure.
Asked how much electricity capacity would be required for the build-out and how this would be supplied, Smith said: “We already have the contracts in place for the power that will be needed for the investments that we’re announcing here.”
Officials said the investment enabled by the tech partnership could speed up development of new medicines and see collaboration on research in areas such as space exploration and defence.

(ORCL) has entered the conversation.
Shares of the database software company have soared 84% this year, the seventh-best performance in the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC), as scorching demand for AI computing turbocharges its revenue growth. The latest leg of the rally came after Oracle projected revenue in its cloud-computing business will jump 700% in the next three fiscal years, sending the stock up 36% on Sept. 10.

Oracle also has been linked to the Trump administration’s negotiations to keep TikTok operating in the US. The company has served as TikTok’s primary cloud infrastructure provider for years. On Wednesday, the White House extended the deadline for its ban of the Chinese video-sharing app until Dec. 16 while talks continue.
The stock is now trading around the highest price-to-estimated earnings since the dot-com era at 43 times, making Oracle more expensive than eight of the nine most valuable companies in the S&P 500. Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), for example, trades at 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months and is expected to have much faster sales growth over that period.
“Investors viewed Oracle as a boring low growth company, and all of a sudden it’s an AI winner,” said Michael Bailey, director of research at Fulton Breakefield Broenniman. “But you’ve got a lot of risk. You’re buying the stock now based on hope that we’re going to see massive growth in year four, five and six.”
The long-term nature of Oracle’s anticipated expansion, with the heaviest growth coming several years from now, is a major reason why its stock looks so expensive, as analysts haven’t adjusted their earnings expectations for the current fiscal year and next. But looking at profits estimated over the next three years, Oracle’s multiple is a more manageable 25 times — although that’s still almost twice the average over the past decade.
“This year is irrelevant, next year is irrelevant, the year after that is more important,” Bailey said. “If you go out a few years, there’s going to be this massive spike in growth. You’ve got to value that today.”
Of course, plenty of investors are comfortable taking a longer-term view with growth stocks. Two of the most popular examples — Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) — are priced at more than 180 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Even over a three-year horizon, Tesla and Palantir are still very expensive at around 100 times."

After climbing to a new all-time high in mid-December, the electric vehicle (EV) leader suddenly shifted into reverse as weak EV sales in its three largest markets punished the stock, which spent the next four months careening lower.
Since bottoming out in early April, Tesla has experienced a remarkable comeback, gaining 76% (as of this writing). Excitement about the potential for the company's robotaxi service fueled most of the move higher. More recently, however, CEO Elon Musk turned heads when he bought a sizable amount of Tesla stock, adding millions of shares to his coffers.
That purchase sparked excitement among Tesla investors. After all, if the chief executive is loading up, is it time for investors to follow suit?
Let's see what's driving the stock higher and dig into the details of Musk's purchase.
What's driving the stock higher?
On June 22, Tesla officially announced the long-awaited debut of its robotaxi service. The event, held in Austin, Texas, offered test rides to select members of the Tesla faithful and a number of social media influencers from X (formerly Twitter) -- some of whom livestreamed their rides for good measure.
The pilot program is ongoing, with an estimated 10 to 20 Model Ys ferrying riders to their destinations, hailed using the Uber app. Musk has previously stated that he expects ""open access"" to the service to begin sometime in September.
While a host of automakers entered the self-driving car race over the years, Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo are the only two that have launched robotaxi services. Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of Ark Invest, estimates that by 2030, there will be roughly 50 million robotaxis operating globally, with Tesla controlling 50% of the market.
Even if that estimate turns out to be ambitious, it's easy to see why investors are excited.
By the numbers
Earlier this month, Tesla's Board of Directors took the extraordinary step of asking shareholders to approve a new $900 billion incentive package for Musk. The deal is contingent on Musk achieving ""extraordinary financial returns."" These include raising Tesla's market cap, first to $2 trillion (up from $1.3 trillion today) and eventually to $8.5 trillion. He would also have to boost Tesla's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), resulting in operating profits of $400 billion, up from $17 billion in 2024.
In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that dropped on Friday, Musk signaled his enthusiasm for the plan. The enigmatic chief executive bought more than 2.5 million shares of Tesla stock, priced in a range of $371.38 and $396.54, spending just short of $1 billion in all on the purchase. Added to the 410 million shares Musk already owned, and using the stock's closing price on Friday, Musk's stake in Tesla has risen to more than $163 billion.
Should investors follow suit?
There's a well-known axiom on Wall Street, popularized by legendary investor Peter Lynch: ""Insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.""
Given Musk's huge vote of confidence in Tesla's future potential, it might seem like a no-brainer to follow suit. More broadly, however, the answer will depend on the individual investor, as there's simply no one-size-fits-all answer.
There's no doubt Tesla is facing challenges in the electric vehicle market. In the second quarter, auto sales revenue of $16.7 billion fell 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales declines. Since this is Tesla's bread and butter, total revenue of $22.5 billion slumped 12%. As a result, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 fell 23%.
An unfortunate side-effect of the decline in Tesla's profits has been a commensurate rise in its already pricey valuation. The stock is currently selling for 237 times earnings and 169 times next year's expected earnings, so it isn't for the faint of heart.
As a general rule, I don't make investing decisions based on whether the company's management is buying or selling. That said, if Tesla can pull off a coup in the robotaxi market (and that's a big if), it could become one of the most successful companies in a generation.
To me, that's worth sticking around to find out."

“The four Product Goals outlined in the proxy provide a good read on Tesla’s LT strategic priorities. By our estimation, the initial achievement of the four product goals would seem to align with the first two EBITDA milestones of $50/$80bln (our 2030E EBITDA = $53bln). Thus, our working assumption is that these product goals are possibly contemplated for achievement around ~2030 (give/take) within the 10yr plan, with remaining EBITDA milestones (up to $400bln) reflecting scalability ambitions.”

It's been manufacturing vehicles in China for more than 20 years. Its first new energy vehicle -- a plug-in hybrid -- was introduced in 2008. BYD then launched a fully battery-powered electric car the next year.
BYD can arguably be called the global EV leader even over Tesla. The Chinese company generates more revenue than Tesla, and it is still growing. One chart may convince investors that its stock is the better buy, too.
BYD's growth is accelerating
BYD has dominated EV sales in China, but it is now seeing growth in Europe. Registrations for BYD vehicles in Europe soared 225% year over year in July, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Much of that is at Tesla's expense, with Tesla registrations down 40% year over year.
BYD is increasing profits, too. In the first half of 2025, net profit grew nearly 14% as revenue climbed 23%. Like Tesla, BYD is facing strong competition globally, and profit margins are under pressure. Unlike Tesla, however, BYD's new energy vehicle sales hit a record high.
It's impressive that revenue is growing so strongly from an already high base.
Trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue has surpassed that of Tesla, and the gap is growing. BYD's revenue growth rate has far outpaced Tesla, too. It soared nearly 500% in the last five years, compared to Tesla's 230% growth.
It's impressive to see the growth rate accelerating for a company with over $100 billion in annual revenue. BYD shares have retreated 20% from record highs over the last three months. That drop created a good opportunity to invest in this global EV leader."

Elon Musk-led Tesla issued a default notice in July after Syrah allegedly failed to deliver conforming active anode material samples from its Louisiana processing facility for Tesla's EV batteries. The original September 16 deadline has now been pushed to November 15.
""While Syrah does not accept it is in default under the offtake agreement, the parties have extended the cure date to 15 November 2025,"" the company stated, adding that both sides are collaborating to resolve the dispute.
The 2021 Tesla contract, worth 8,000 tonnes annually for a four-year period, underpins Syrah's Louisiana Vidalia facility and its broader strategy to become America's first major non-Chinese graphite supplier.
The facility represents the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer outside China, helping reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese supplies that currently dominate the market.
The extension offers temporary relief as Syrah battles to establish itself in the strategic battery materials sector amid intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions.
Tesla may terminate the deal if Syrah's Vidalia facility fails to achieve final qualification of its anode material by February 9, 2026.

The wave of new launches reflects issuers responding to that demand: So far this year, more than a dozen new single-stock leveraged ETFs have launched in Hong Kong, data compiled by Bloomberg show, compared with just three linked to indexes in 2024 and none in 2023. On trading platform Moomoo, US-listed funds like the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (ticker TQQQ) and the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (TSLL) consistently rank among the most-traded securities for Hong Kong investors. SQQQ, a Nasdaq 100-focused 3x inverse ETF, finds itself not far behind.
“What drew me in was the potential to supercharge returns, especially when vanilla index gains felt underwhelming,” Miao said. “Volatility comes with the territory, but I’m comfortable holding if I believe in the long-term story.”
Trading activity has surged in Hong Kong. Total value traded in leveraged and inverse ETFs has reached $80 billion, a more than 60% jump from the same period last year, Bloomberg-compiled data shows.
At the same time, net flows have been muted: investors have pulled more than $284 million from the high-octane universe, more than double last year’s outflows and a sharp reversal from the $533 million of inflows seen in 2023, according to data analyzed by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Andre Yapp. Such whipsawing flows are typical during bouts of volatility like this year’s tariff-fueled market angst, while net allocations remain below the unprecedented boom of the pandemic years.
“Short-term trades are now the name of the game,” said Kenny Ng, strategist at China Everbright Securities International. “To chase sharper returns and capitalize on quick moves, they’re leaning into leveraged and inverse products, zeroing in on high-liquidity, large-cap names and major indexes.”"

Uber Freight founder and chairman Lior Ron announced the Tesla partnership on Tuesday during Deliver 2025, the company’s annual summit held this year in Jacksonville, Florida.
“This is the first program of its kind, truly designed to help fleets and shippers adopt electric trucks at scale and with confidence,” Ron said.
The Dedicated EV Fleet Accelerator Program is a direct response to widespread industry feedback, Uber Freight officials said. The program will give fleets subsidized access to Tesla Semi trucks, guaranteed demand from Uber Freight’s shipper network, and direct support to maximize vehicle utilization and long-term return on investment.
While electric trucks offer significant operational savings over time, high upfront costs, charging infrastructure gaps, and uncertainty around revenue potential have often discouraged broader adoption, Ron said.
“We’re going to work together with Tesla to really educate fleets and really help them accelerate the adoption of electric trucks … by helping with financing and making the price of these beautiful trucks actually equal to the price of diesel trucks. We’re going to work with those fleets to fully optimize their network and fully optimize their charging location and freight routes to ensure that charging is seamless in their operation as well,” Ron said.
Tesla unveiled the all-electric Class 8 Semi truck in 2017 and began manufacturing units in 2022. Mass production is expected to start at the end of 2025, with the Semi expected to go on sale in 2026. The truck has an estimated range of 300 to 500 miles carrying a full load.
Under the program:
-
Fleets purchasing Tesla Semi trucks will receive a price subsidy.
-
Fleets will integrate their Tesla Semi trucks into Uber Freight’s dedicated solutions for shippers for a pre-determined period.
-
Uber Freight taps into its extensive freight network to match carriers with consistent freight from its shipper base.
During a two-month pilot of the EV accelerator program, the Tesla Semi trucks clocked over 394 hours of drive time, with carriers covering 12,377 miles. The trucks averaged net energy consumption of 1.72 kWh per mile on 60 hours of total charge time.
Deliver 2025 is a three-day event that includes around 200 shippers and industry experts discussing topics such as last mile, fraud, tariffs, nearshoring, AI, cross-border logistics and intermodal."

The Tesla board has managed to avoid what could have been a tricky investor vote on requiring political neutrality among executives, after the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled the electric vehicle manufacturer could exclude a shareholder proposal on the matter from its 2025 annual materials, according to a copy of the SEC’s letter obtained by Fortune.
The proposal was submitted by Jay Butera, 67, a staunch climate advocate and investor who has held shares in Tesla since the company’s 2010 IPO. Butera’s neutrality proposal, if approved by shareholders, would have prohibited Tesla leadership from making political statements, endorsements, or contributions in support or opposition to political parties or candidates. Butera, a retired entrepreneur who still holds millions of dollars’ worth of Tesla stock, is a die-hard renewable energy supporter and previously lobbied for the creation of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House of Representatives in 2016.
Butera said he’s disappointed in the outcome because he thinks the proposal would have helped Tesla advance its “mission of accelerating sustainability,” which he views as vital to the world. He told Fortune he doesn’t want to see the company “jeopardized by unnecessary forays into the endless friction of human politics. The Tesla brand, and its mission, should stay above that fray.”
“I hope Tesla’s board at least takes note of my proposal’s intent and the investor interest in the concept,” Butera wrote in an email. “They can exclude my proposal from the ballot on technical grounds, but the issue remains—political perceptions are still harming the Tesla brand, reducing sales, and stressing government relations. I hope the board will find a way to improve that.”
The Tesla board in August sent a letter to the SEC seeking to exclude the proposal from its 2025 proxy materials without risking an enforcement action from regulators. Like most publicly traded companies, the $1.3 trillion EV and robotics company sends proxy materials to Tesla shareholders in advance of its annual meetings each year. Excluding the proposal means investors won’t get a chance to vote on it at the upcoming meeting in November.
However, some Tesla investors have been hoping for the board to more directly address the issue. Retail, individual investors who hold thousands of shares in the company have submitted and upvoted questions related to CEO Elon Musk’s role in politics—and his time spent on matters pertaining to Tesla—on shareholder platforms Tesla uses to solicit queries before quarterly earnings calls every quarter since late 2024. Butera’s proposal would have been the first time investors had a chance to vote directly on the issue of politics and their impact on the EV maker’s business."

The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.13%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.27%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.07%.
Shares of the electric car maker have appreciated by 22.34% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 14.6%, and the S&P 500's gain of 2.71%.
The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Tesla in its upcoming release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.48, down 33.33% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $25.12 billion, indicating a 0.23% decrease compared to the same quarter of the previous year.
Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $1.66 per share and revenue of $92.65 billion. These totals would mark changes of -31.4% and -5.16%, respectively, from last year.
It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Tesla. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.35% lower. At present, Tesla boasts a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).
From a valuation perspective, Tesla is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 247.36. This represents a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 13.93.
One should further note that TSLA currently holds a PEG ratio of 10.33. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The average PEG ratio for the Automotive - Domestic industry stood at 2.44 at the close of the market yesterday.
The Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 162, positioning it in the bottom 35% of all 250+ industries."

On Monday, the billionaire entrepreneur announced a $1 billion purchase of Tesla shares, his first major reaction after Oracle founder Larry Ellison overtook him as the world’s richest man through an AI deal with NVIDIA.

Musk further emphasized his focus on Tesla while responding to community speculation on X on Tuesday.
Dogecoin derivatives markets also priced in the potential impacts of Elon Musk’s attention shifting towards Tesla, at the expense of projects like Dogecoin.
According to Coinglass, Dogecoin futures trading volume plunged 26.39% to $9.41 billion, while open interest fell 3.85% to $5.35 billion. This represents over $200 million in liquidated open positions despite 1% spot price gains within the last 24 hours.
This signals that while some Dogecoin traders are front-running potential ETF approval with spot purchases, short-term speculators trimmed leverage exposure in response to Musk’s latest pivot towards Tesla and the looming Fed rate decision.
Dogecoin Price Forecast: Can Bulls Reclaim the $0.29 Peak?
Dogecoin price remains in neutral territory, having retraced from the local high of $0.29 last week to hold the $0.26 support line on Tuesday.
If declining open interest triggers sell-offs in spot markets, the Keltner Channel midline near $0.246 offers initial support against downswings. However, a close below that level could see Dogecoin price fall toward the lower boundary at $0.21.
The MACD remains positive but shows flattening momentum, suggesting bulls may be losing ground. For DOGE to retest $0.29, buyers must reclaim the $0.28 resistance zone with volume support.
If the ETF verdict lands favorably, this breakout could validate a run toward $0.32, marking a fresh high for Dogecoin price in 2025.
Conversely, failure to defend $0.26 ahead of the Fed decision could see DOGE fall into a consolidation range between $0.21 and $0.24.
Snorter Presale Nears $4M as Dogecoin Traders Seek Alternatives
As Dogecoin’s price swings around ETF speculation and Elon Musk’s latest Tesla investments, Snorter Bot, a Solana-based presale project, is also gaining market traction.
Snorter offers ultra-low transaction fees, lightning-fast execution, and exclusive early access to token launches.
The SNORT token presale has already raised $3.9 million of its $4.4 million target, with momentum accelerating as traders rotate capital from volatile majors into early-stage opportunities. With less than 24 hours before the next price increase, prospective investors can still enter via the official Snorter website.

(Reuters) - Tesla has reached confidential deals to resolve two lawsuits over deaths in two separate California crashes in 2019 involving the company's Autopilot advanced-driver-assistance software, according to court documents.
The settlements come weeks after a Florida jury ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in compensatory and punitive damages to the victims of another fatal 2019 crash of a Model S that was equipped with Autopilot.
Tesla hired a trio of prominent new lawyers and asked a judge to find the verdict legally unjustified and throw out the case, or to order a new trial.
The electric-vehicle maker, which has settled several other cases involving its vehicles and self-driving technology, had rejected a $60 million settlement proposal for the Florida lawsuit, a filing showed last month.
The Florida verdict and the two settlements in California are significant as much of Tesla's $1.4 trillion valuation hangs on CEO Elon Musk's promise to rapidly expand its robotaxis and the full self-driving (FSD) software that underpins them. FSD is an advanced version of Autopilot.
One lawsuit, the settlement notice for which was filed on Tuesday, relates to the death of a 15-year-old boy who was traveling in Alameda County, California, with his father in a vehicle when it was rear-ended by a Tesla Model 3, which had Autopilot engaged, causing the victim's vehicle to roll over and crash into the center barrier. The boy succumbed to his injuries from the collision.
The other case relates to the death in December 2019 of two people who were traveling through an intersection in Gardena, California, in a Honda Civic when a Tesla Model S, equipped with Autopilot, failed to stop at a red light at high speed and crashed into the victims' vehicle.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comments. Representatives for the plaintiffs' lawyers did not comment on the Alameda case and did not respond to a request for comment on the Gardena case.
The settlement in the Gardena case is only with Tesla while the trial is set to continue against the driver of the Model S vehicle and some of the other defendants, according to the notice filed last week and seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
Neither notice disclosed the terms of the accords. They said that the dismissals of the lawsuits were conditioned on ""satisfactory completion of specified terms.""
Trials for both the cases were scheduled to start next month - one in Alameda County Superior Court and the other in Los Angeles County Superior Court. A judge in the Alameda Superior Court vacated the scheduled trial on Tuesday, while Tesla and the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw their petitions in the Los Angeles trial, according to the court orders.

In an otherwise light week on economic data, investors received the latest figures on retail sales on Tuesday showing strong consumer spending despite sticky inflation and a wobbly labor market. Retail sales in August rose 0.6% from the prior month, more than the 0.2% expected.
Tesla (TSLA) stock rose 2% on Tuesday after wiping out its year-to-date losses on Monday following CEO Elon Musk's purchase of shares in the EV maker.

In other Fed news, the Senate narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, President Trump's Fed pick, in a 48-47 vote on Monday evening. The move has put Miran in place just in time to cast his vote at the central bank's meeting.
Though Miran has said he would act independently, his intention to take a leave of absence — but not resign — from his current role as a White House advisor has raised questions about the future of Fed independence, especially as Trump pursues firing Fed governor Lisa Cook.

Oil jumps following Ukraine attacks on Russian energy infrastructure
Oil prices jumped 1% on Tuesday as investors assessed the threat to Russian energy supplies following Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries and the impact a potential Federal rate cut decision could have on demand.
West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures surpassed $64 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F) futures rose above $68 per barrel.
Ukraine upped its attacks on Russian ports and energy infrastructure, prompting supply shock worries.

HIMS falls after FDA posts warning letter over 'misleading' claims
Hims & Hers (HIMS) shares dropped 7% Tuesday after the US Food and Drug Administration posted a warning letter sent to the company on Sept. 9 stating that it made false or misleading claims in its marketing of its compounded semaglutide products.
The FDA's public posting of the letter comes after the New York Times obtained a copy and reported some of the details last week.
Hims & Hers stock has had a volatile year, but shares are up roughly 107% in 2025. In June, the stock suffered after Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) ended its partnership with HIMS, accusing the company of ""deceptive"" marketing.
HIMS is one of the top ten most shorted stocks in the US, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence Data, with some 30% of the company's shares currently sold short.

Shares of Klarna (KLAR) rose as much as 4% Tuesday before paring gains as Wall Street analysts initiated coverage of the Swedish buy now, pay later leader following its successful debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week.
Analysts at Needham and Morningstar initiated coverage of Klarna with Hold ratings, while Compass Point Research analyst Dominick Gabriele began covering the stock with a Buy rating.
Gabriele wrote in a note to clients Monday that the buy now, pay later (BNPL) space ""has high volume growth rates"" as payments become digitized.
He said that given BNPL industry growth combined with ""numerous company specific opportunities, including Klarna penetrating further into the US,"" he expects the company to outperform its peers.
""As Klarna pushes into the US they are likely to be a market share taker against current BNPL US incumbents both in Pay Later and longer duration BNPL products,"" Gabriele wrote.

Warner Bros. Discovery stock plummets amid analyst downgrades
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares sank 8% Tuesday following downgrades from TD Cowen and MorningStar analysts to Hold from Buy on Monday, per Bloomberg data.
TD Cowen analyst Douglas Creutz said the stock has risen ""well beyond our $14 price target following last week's unsubstantiated report that Paramount SkyDance (PSKY) may be considering a bid for the company.""
Warner Bros. shares spiked close to 50% in just two trading days last week after a Wall Street Journal report said Paramount Skydance was preparing a majority-cash bid for the media conglomerate — a potential move that could set off a Hollywood bidding war and reshape the global streaming landscape, Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reported.
Creutz pointed to ""the speculative nature of the current [WBD stock] rally and the elevated risk profile at these levels.""
Creutz said that while a Paramount Skydance offer for the company ""may come in ... we don't love the risk-reward here given the potential for WBD shares to quickly round trip to $11-$12 if the bid doesn't materialize.""

Ralph Lauren dips after sharing long term financial outlook
Ralph Lauren (RL) shares fell more than 1% Tuesday as the fashion company gave a three year financial outlook that disappointed investors.
The company said in an update Tuesday that it sees revenue growing in the mid-single digits over the next three years. Ralph Lauren reported revenue rising roughly 6.8% to nearly $7.1 billion in its 2025 fiscal year. That's after climbing about 3% to just over $6.6 billion in the previous year.
""The Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, tariffs and other consumer spending-related headwinds, global supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility, among other factors,"" it said in the statement.
Shares in Ralph Lauren are up 34% in 2025.

Oracle rises amid reports of software giant's role in US-China TikTok deal
Oracle (ORCL) stock rose nearly 3% on Tuesday after CBS News reported that the company will be among a consortium of firms that are part of the preliminary US-China deal to enable TikTok to continue operations.
Meanwhile, CNBC reported that the two countries' agreement would allow Oracle to continue its current cloud deal with TikTok. Oracle's servers are used to store TikTok's American user data, part of an initiative called Project Texas, launched by TikTok around 2022.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a press conference Monday that the US and China agreed on a framework for a TikTok deal during trade talks in Madrid, ahead of a US ban of the social media app. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to speak on Friday to ""complete"" the agreement.
As gold (GC=F) continued to climb to new records, it surpassed $3,700 an ounce for the first time Tuesday after the asset saw an all-time high of around $3,685 an ounce Monday.

Retail sales top forecasts in August
Americans just keep spending.
Retail sales in August rose 0.6% from the prior month, more than the 0.2% expected and the latest sign that US consumers continue to be resilient in the face of a labor market that has shown some signs of stress.
Excluding spending on cars and gas, sales rose 0.7% last month.
The largest category increases were seen in spending at clothing stores and nonstore retailers — which captures e-commerce spending — suggesting a strong back-to-school shopping season. The retail sales data is not adjusted for inflation.
""Net, net, the consumer hasn’t pulled the plug on the economy yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, ""and until they do, growth will continue to chug along at a moderate pace that seems to defy gravity in the face of rising tariff costs and store-bought prices.""

The recall affects an unspecified number of Powerwall 2 units made in the U.S. and sold between November 2020 and June 2022. The cells were made by an unnamed third-party supplier. Despite the fires, no injuries have been reported, the ACCC said in a recall notice.
The Powerwall 2 contains 14 kWh of lithium ion batteries, and its usually installed alongside solar panels to store excess power generated during the day.
Customers can also enroll their batteries in a virtual power plant to support the grid in times of heavy load. Enrolling extends the warranty to up to 15 years and gives customers access to time-of-use rates that will help reduce energy bills, Tesla says.
Homeowners will be notified in the Tesla app if their Powerwall is part of the recall, and the company is in the process of discharging the batteries to reduce the risk of fire. Recalled batteries will be replaced free of charge, and the company “will consider compensation for lost energy savings … on a case-by-case basis,” the ACCC said."

Fort Lauderdale, FL, Sept. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PharmAGRI Capital Partners today announced its strategic focus on capturing a $10 billion total addressable market (TAM) in federal procurement of plant-based prescription drugs currently sourced from foreign manufacturers. This segment, while modest in size compared to the broader pharmaceutical industry, represents a critical opportunity to restore control, compliance, and domestic production with a fair transparent pricing model.
CEO Statement:
""The $10B TAM is not about volume—it’s about control. Federal agencies already procure these drugs, often from foreign sources. Our goal is to ensure they contract with a sovereign platform like PharmAGRI that can produce and manufacture them on U.S. soil. With Tesla robotics powering our facilities and DEA-licensed infrastructure in place, we can scale with precision, meet federal sourcing mandates, and deliver therapies that are compliant, secure, and American-made.""
— Lynn Stockwell, Chairwoman & CEO
PharmAGRI’s vertically integrated “seed to prescription drug” model aligns DEA quota with federal contract obligations, enabling predictable scaling and secure sourcing. The company has executed Letters of Intent, one for partnering with Tesla to deploy up to 10,000 Optimus Gen3+ humanoid robots across its SuperPharm and CEA facilities, automating labor, compliance and ensuring diversion control.
Following the merger with Bright Green Corporation (OTC: BGXX), PharmAGRI using the Bright Green assets as the proof of concept, absorbing DEA registrations, Nasdaq, and audited financial history, positioning the company for relisting under a new ticker symbol. A Form S-1 registration statement is in preparation, and no lock-up restrictions will be imposed on non-affiliate shareholders, ensuring full liquidity upon relisting.
Investor Q&A: PharmAGRI–BGXX Merger, Relisting Strategy, and Shareholder Liquidity
Q: What happens to Bright Green Corporation once the merger is approved?
A: Bright Green Corporation will merge out of existence. Its assets, DEA registrations, and Nasdaq history will be absorbed into PharmAGRI Capital Partners. BGXX shareholders will become shareholders of PharmAGRI and may sell or trade their equity once PharmAGRI is relisted on Nasdaq.
Q: What changed with Bright Green Corporation under Lynn Stockwell’s leadership?
A: On January 1, 2025, Lynn Stockwell took full control. She terminated prior management, replaced the board, and assumed the role of CEO and Chairwoman. She initiated a court-supervised restructuring that will merge Bright Green into PharmAGRI Capital Partners, consolidating critical assets and will provide the necessary capital upon confirmation."

Following the recent Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rally, CEO Elon Musk has recovered almost all of the wealth he lost since his meeting with President Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.
Elon Musk Is The World's Richest Person...Again
The billionaire, who was briefly overtaken by Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison, has reclaimed the title again. The news was first reported by Business Insider on Monday. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Musk stands at the top with a $429 billion fortune, just a few billion shy of his January 1 figure of $431 billion.
The surge in value follows Tesla's stock rally and $1 billion share purchase made by Musk. Tesla stock currently sits at $419.25 in pre-market trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.
Trending: Would You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform
However, the stock price was down 45% YTD at its lowest this year in April, coinciding with Musk's net worth dropping to $290 billion, putting him well below the richest person mark.
Elon Musk’s Political Exploits
This came after Musk had expressed support for President Donald Trump's campaign last year and donated more than $250 million to the cause and later joined the administration, forming the DOGE or Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk later also had a falling out with Trump, threatening to withdraw his company, SpaceX, from NASA missions, as well as calling Trump out on his alleged ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Musk also shared plans to found a political party, but ultimately, exited DOGE and involvement with the government, a move that was hailed by investors.
Elon Musk's Trillion-Dollar Pay Package
The Tesla board of directors also recently unveiled a pay package for Musk, which could, if all the conditions and milestones it stipulates are met, make Musk the first trillionaire in history. Musk's pay package has been criticized by politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) as well as Pope Leo.
The pay package also stipulates that Tesla must reach a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and includes conditions like 10 million active FSD subscriptions, among other things. Interestingly, Tesla recently revised the definition of the FSD technology amid its Robotaxi expansion in Austin.

Founders hold a unique ability to shape and grow a company from inception, much like a parent nurturing a child. They have a clear vision and relentlessly back their ventures. Unlike traditional managers, founders often take greater risks, pursue unconventional ideas and drive innovation with bold choices. Their businesses frequently mirror their core values, ideals, and long-term aspirations, making them enduring reflections of their dedication and ambition.
Founder-run companies represent less than 5% of the S&P 500 index. But that does not make their contribution any less. Everyone is aware of the success stories of visionary founder-owners like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who have redefined industries, creating trillion-dollar companies that continue to thrive. Some of today’s prominent founder-run companies are NVIDIA, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet and Netflix. Founder-led companies represent nearly 15% of the total index’s market capitalization, with technology companies taking the lead.
These companies, often sparked by unique ideas, are typically rooted in technological innovation. Built from scratch, they are designed to withstand challenges and remain sustainable over the long run. In the early stages, others may struggle to see the founder’s vision, making fundraising difficult. As a result, founders frequently invest their personal savings to bootstrap operations. If the venture succeeds, it may later attract angel investors or external funding, yet the founder-owner consistently bears the greatest stake and risk.
Moreover, founder-owners often struggle to delegate responsibilities, driven by skepticism about whether others can truly match their level of commitment or understanding. Thus, they tend to assume multiple senior roles and frequently struggle to identify a capable successor. Yet, excelling across all areas is rarely feasible. This hesitation to delegate can restrict the infusion of professional expertise, potentially impeding the company’s ability to scale effectively or respond swiftly to changing market dynamics.
Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that founder-led companies tend to perform better over time. Per a Harvard Business Review Study, founder-led companies had a market-adjusted return of 12% over three years against a return of negative 26% for companies that hired a professional CEO. Our Founder-Run Companies Screen further makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks. Currently, stocks like AppLovin Corporation APP, Palantir Technologies PLTR, Blackstone Inc. BX and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD look appealing.

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-16T17:39:19,Waymo approved to start testing autonomous vehicles at San Francisco International Airport,"Waymo has spent years locked in back-and-forth negotiations with SFO, the biggest airport serving its home base of Silicon Valley.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2e8c73cb67ffc378d48e2e2766be61c217d2dffb008248ba682c128574be4a4b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-approved-start-testing-autonomous-163919384.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-approved-start-testing-autonomous-163919384.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waymo-approved-start-testing-autonomous-163919384.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Waymo has been granted a permit to start testing its autonomous vehicles at San Francisco International Airport, ahead of the launch of a commercial service.
The San Francisco mayor’s office announced Tuesday that the airport, known as SFO, and Waymo have signed a “Testing and Operations Pilot Permit” after years of back-and-forth negotiations. The deal with SFO comes just two weeks after Waymo was cleared to start testing at nearby San Jose Mineta International Airport — and as Tesla is also trying to elbow its way into offering ride-hail service to these airports.
SFO is not the first airport that Waymo will serve; the company has been operating at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport since 2023. But SFO has been a target for Waymo for just as long, if not longer, as it’s the biggest airport serving the company’s home base of Silicon Valley.
Airport authorities initially rebuffed Waymo back in 2023, but this year Waymo was granted a permit to start mapping the airport, a clear indicator that the relationship had thawed.
The newly granted permit allows Waymo to move forward in three phases. The first will see Waymo test its AVs in autonomous mode with a “trained specialist” behind the wheel. The second will involve Waymo testing passenger service with employees and airport staff. The third phase will allow Waymo to start offering paid rides.
Once Waymo enters that third phase, the company says it will offer pickups and drop-offs at the airport’s “Kiss & Fly area,” which requires an AirTrain ride to reach the terminals. The company says it intends to “explore other locations at the airport in the future.”
Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli told TechCrunch that the company will begin testing “very soon,” but declined to put a time frame on the remaining phases. He said that the third phase of offering paid rides will continue on a “month-to-month” basis while Waymo works with SFO on a “sustained commercial operations permit.”
Offering rides to and from SFO would be the latest in a growing list of accomplishments for Waymo this year. The company has expanded to multiple new cities, with an increasing number of partners, like Uber, and more are on the horizon for 2026. Waymo has been growing its service area in Silicon Valley as well, making service to SFO seem increasingly inevitable.
This story has been updated with new information from Waymo about timing."

Solaris Energy Inc. (SEI) has seen its stock surge nearly 4x in the past year after pivoting from oilfield services into AI-linked infrastructure through the $200 million acquisition of Mobile Energy Rentals in 2024. However, the business is now showing signs of unraveling. SEI’s power rental segment is fundamentally a commoditized business with no proprietary technology, relying almost entirely on a single customer—Elon Musk’s xAI.
The Colossus data center in Memphis has been SEI’s only major site, but xAI has already removed a majority of SEI’s turbines as new substations and Tesla battery storage came online, and plans to idle the rest later this year. Despite SEI’s bullish claims of capacity expansion, xAI has publicly said there will be no mobile generators at its planned second site. Industry experts also suggest SEI’s equipment has been stressed by power oscillations during AI model training, further limiting sustainability.
The risks are compounded by SEI’s questionable management history, inconsistent disclosures versus xAI, and reliance on contracts whose termination clauses and idle asset treatment remain opaque. Meanwhile, competitors from Fortress to Atlas Energy are piling into mobile power rentals, signaling frothy conditions in an already crowded space. SEI trades at ~40x forward earnings and ~6x tangible book value, pricing in aggressive consensus expectations for $3+ EPS by 2027.
Yet, if idling continues and no new customers emerge, EBITDA could fall to $200 million by 2026 versus the $363 million consensus, driving EPS to ~$0.50. At normalized multiples, shares could retrace to $5–10, implying over 80% downside. With no free cash flow expected until 2026 and rising leverage from the MER acquisition, SEI faces significant boom-bust risk. This is a matter of “when, not if,” with looming catalysts from xAI’s shifting power strategy and likely earnings misses.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Solaris Energy Infrastructure, Inc. (SEI) by LiterallyAzzmilk in March 2025, which highlighted the company’s growth through the Mobile Energy Rentals acquisition and its positioning in high-demand energy markets. The stock appreciated modestly as initial optimism played out. Bluewater12 shares a contrarian view, emphasizing risks from customer concentration, temporary turbine deployments, and potential earnings downside, challenging the sustainability of SEI’s growth thesis."

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) has rallied sharply in recent months, but Morgan Stanley believes the stock still isn't widely held among big institutional investors. Analyst Adam Jonas outlined his Thoughts at $410 this week, pointing to several factors that could support further gains.
Jonas, who recently called Tesla the bank's top pick at the Laguna Conference, said only a handful of investors at the event reported owning the stock in size. That underexposure, he argues, leaves room for more buying.
A central point for Morgan Stanley is Elon Musk's role as what it called a talent magnet. The firm believes Musk's presence is critical for drawing the AI and robotics expertise needed to deliver on Tesla's next phase, including its Master Plan 4.
Morgan Stanley also emphasized Tesla's position in physical AI, saying it gives the company one of the largest long-term market opportunities among the major U.S. tech names.
On the product side, Jonas noted improvements in Tesla's Full Self-Driving software and the ease of its purchase process. He described adding Grok, the AI assistant from X, into the vehicle as a standout feature that makes the driving experience more engaging.
The analyst acknowledged ongoing criticism around Musk's proposed $1 trillion pay package but said if Tesla achieves the required milestones, shareholders are unlikely to object."

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.
Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Eli Lily, Nvidia and Tesla. First up, Eli Lily, the pharma giant announcing a $5 billion investment in Virginia as it expands its domestic manufacturing. Joining us for more, our own Brooke De Palma. So, Eli Lily making this announcement. So many companies that have been making these kinds of announcements, right?
Do you even know that there's a list on the White House.gov with all the investments?
I did not know that, but I see you have it pulled up.
Well, we have it pulled up. Yeah. And and you can see that this joins others like the Lake of Merk, AstraZeneca, Nova Nordisk, also making these major investments. And really this just goes to show that companies are jumping in saying that they're willing to splurge or willing to spend and invest in manufacturing here in the US, especially because of these tariffs.
Right. Although many of them were already making these kinds of plans and announcements. What's also interesting about this one from Eli Lily is it doesn't seem like this will be a GLP one or or obesity, um drug manufacturing facility. Um this will be at least ingredients that are more targeted. It looks like um autoimmune diseases, lung cancer, so other types of of diseases.
Yeah, and I think also too, if you take a look at today's retail sales print, we did see health and personal care stores spending their increase about 6.6%. It really jumped out year over year that is because it was one of the largest jumps. And I think they just goes to show that drug pricing and how much we essentially pay for these goods really has been a top focus not only for these companies but the administration. And so now Eli Lilly looking to get into this conversation with this investment.
Well, not only that, the jobs report also, I mean, healthcare has been one of the more um consistent growing parts of the job market even while other parts are are pulling back. So that's something to keep an eye on as well. Um let's also talk about Nvidia because Reuters is reporting the company is seeing uh tepid demand uh in China for its products, for its new chip in particular. This of course coming amid reporting the government told companies to avoid using its products and as China says that Nvidia vi- violated monopoly laws. Treasury Secretary Beson also saying he expressed his displeasure over that finding by China.
Yeah, and right now the stock isn't really responding too heavily. It's down about 1% in this pre-market trading. Of course, Nvidia has seen such growth year to date up more than 30%. But also this just reminds me of the interview that you did not too long ago with the CEO Jenson Wong. He said specifically that they have an opportunity to succeed in the China market if they would allow for American tech companies to be able to be to play there. And so I really think this is sort of a bigger conversation about how exactly these American led tech companies, AI companies play in this market and the way in which they do it that still boosts demand there, which essentially has really pulled back.
Yeah, and you know, this um lack of reaction today to this is is not necessarily surprising because we already knew that the Chinese government had sort of constrained the the demand for this chip there. So we'll see um how
They didn't include it in their forward-looking guidance. That was sort of expected.
Right exactly. Exactly. And finally, let's talk about Tesla. US auto safety regulators have opened an investigation into whether some Tesla vehicle doors are defective, citing incidents in which exterior handles stopped working and trapped people inside the cars during um accidents, which is terrifying. Yeah.
Highly concerning. Yet the stock not reacting to this news.
Yeah.
The stock is up about 2% and that's really because of this ongoing momentum that we saw on Monday's trading session after Elon Musk purchased 2.6 million shares of the company, the most since 2020 worth about $1 billion. And also this just goes to show that the momentum behind Tesla, especially with now Elon Musk really jumping back in, showing his loyalty, his position within the company, his focus on the company, has investors excited that they're willing to just sort of put aside this other noise around the company.
I guess I mean this is I don't know if it's noise or not, but specifically by the way, this is the 2021 model year model Y um where this investigation is happening. So we'll see how that plays out.
Yeah, they they said that a child may not be able to access or operate the releases even if the vehicle's driver is aware of them. So essentially once a person walks out, they may have a hard time getting access back in. I mean, there's just so many concerns around this report. They also said that within this report from Bloomberg, they said that um in China, a top regulator is reportedly considering a ban on those fully concealed door handles. And can I just say Julie, sometimes I even have trouble opening up those concealed door handles. And so I'd be interesting to see where this ends up rolling out to be.
Sometimes a car doesn't have to look cool, it just has to work.
Just has to drive us to the place.
And let us out when we got to get out of the out of it. All right, thanks Brooke. Well, you can scan the QR code below to check the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page."

Oil jumps following Ukraine attacks on Russian energy infrastructure
Oil prices jumped 1% on Tuesday as investors assessed the threat to Russian energy supplies following Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries and the impact a potential Federal rate cut decision could have on demand.
West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures surpassed $64 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F) futures rose above $68 per barrel.
Ukraine upped its attacks on Russian ports and energy infrastructure, prompting supply shock worries.
Meanwhile, investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points on Wednesday following its two-day policy meeting, potentially spurring demand from increased economic activity.
Despite a recent rise in oil prices, WTI and Brent are down about 9% and 8%, respectively, year to date.

Retail sales show US consumer spending holds up, but 'almost everyone' is looking for deals
HIMS falls after FDA posts warning letter over 'misleading' claims
Hims & Hers (HIMS) shares dropped 7% Tuesday after the US Food and Drug Administration posted a warning letter sent to the company on Sept. 9 stating that it made false or misleading claims in its marketing of its compounded semaglutide products.
The FDA's public posting of the letter comes after the New York Times obtained a copy and reported some of the details last week.
Hims & Hers stock has had a volatile year, but shares are up roughly 107% in 2025. In June, the stock suffered after Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) ended its partnership with HIMS, accusing the company of ""deceptive"" marketing.
HIMS is one of the top ten most shorted stocks in the US, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence Data, with some 30% of the company's shares currently sold short.

A 'jobless expansion' is the market’s latest bull case as Fed rate cut looms
Shares of Klarna (KLAR) rose as much as 4% Tuesday before paring gains as Wall Street analysts initiated coverage of the Swedish buy now, pay later leader following its successful debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week.
Analysts at Needham and Morningstar initiated coverage of Klarna with Hold ratings, while Compass Point Research analyst Dominick Gabriele began covering the stock with a Buy rating.
Gabriele wrote in a note to clients Monday that the buy now, pay later (BNPL) space ""has high volume growth rates"" as payments become digitized.
He said that given BNPL industry growth combined with ""numerous company specific opportunities, including Klarna penetrating further into the US,"" he expects the company to outperform its peers.
""As Klarna pushes into the US they are likely to be a market share taker against current BNPL US incumbents both in Pay Later and longer duration BNPL products,"" Gabriele wrote.
Klarna was up nearly 1% in midday trading as the major stock indexes reversed earlier gains.

Warner Bros. Discovery stock plummets amid analyst downgrades
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares sank 8% Tuesday following downgrades from TD Cowen and MorningStar analysts to Hold from Buy on Monday, per Bloomberg data.
TD Cowen analyst Douglas Creutz said the stock has risen ""well beyond our $14 price target following last week's unsubstantiated report that Paramount SkyDance (PSKY) may be considering a bid for the company.""
Warner Bros. shares spiked close to 50% in just two trading days last week after a Wall Street Journal report said Paramount Skydance was preparing a majority-cash bid for the media conglomerate — a potential move that could set off a Hollywood bidding war and reshape the global streaming landscape, Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reported.
Creutz pointed to ""the speculative nature of the current [WBD stock] rally and the elevated risk profile at these levels.""
Creutz said that while a Paramount Skydance offer for the company ""may come in ... we don't love the risk-reward here given the potential for WBD shares to quickly round trip to $11-$12 if the bid doesn't materialize.""

Ralph Lauren dips after sharing long term financial outlook
Ralph Lauren (RL) shares fell more than 1% Tuesday as the fashion company gave a three year financial outlook that disappointed investors.
The company said in an update Tuesday that it sees revenue growing in the mid-single digits over the next three years. Ralph Lauren reported revenue rising roughly 6.8% to nearly $7.1 billion in its 2025 fiscal year. That's after climbing about 3% to just over $6.6 billion in the previous year.
""The Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, tariffs and other consumer spending-related headwinds, global supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility, among other factors,"" it said in the statement.
Shares in Ralph Lauren are up 34% in 2025.

Oracle rises amid reports of software giant's role in US-China TikTok deal
Oracle (ORCL) stock rose nearly 3% on Tuesday after CBS News reported that the company will be among a consortium of firms that are part of the preliminary US-China deal to enable TikTok to continue operations.
Meanwhile, CNBC reported that the two countries' agreement would allow Oracle to continue its current cloud deal with TikTok. Oracle's servers are used to store TikTok's American user data, part of an initiative called Project Texas, launched by TikTok around 2022.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a press conference Monday that the US and China agreed on a framework for a TikTok deal during trade talks in Madrid, ahead of a US ban of the social media app. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to speak on Friday to ""complete"" the agreement.
As gold (GC=F) continued to climb to new records, it surpassed $3,700 an ounce for the first time Tuesday after the asset saw an all-time high of around $3,685 an ounce Monday.

Retail sales top forecasts in August
Americans just keep spending.
Retail sales in August rose 0.6% from the prior month, more than the 0.2% expected and the latest sign that US consumers continue to be resilient in the face of a labor market that has shown some signs of stress.
Excluding spending on cars and gas, sales rose 0.7% last month.
The largest category increases were seen in spending at clothing stores and nonstore retailers — which captures e-commerce spending — suggesting a strong back-to-school shopping season. The retail sales data is not adjusted for inflation.
""Net, net, the consumer hasn’t pulled the plug on the economy yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, ""and until they do, growth will continue to chug along at a moderate pace that seems to defy gravity in the face of rising tariff costs and store-bought prices.""

- Tesla shares are trading at their highest levels since January after gaining ground for five straight days, with the latest boost coming from news that CEO Elon Musk had purchased about $1 billion worth of the company's stock.

Tesla (TSLA) shares are trading at their highest levels since January after gaining ground for five straight days, with the latest boost coming from news that CEO Elon Musk had purchased about $1 billion worth of the company's stock.
The stock, which moved back into positive territory for 2025 on Monday, has seen its shares surge recently amid optimism about the company’s robotics prospects and signs of progress in rolling out its autonomous driving technology. For much of the year, the stock had been the weakest performer among members of the Magnificent Seven group of mega-cap tech stocks, weighed down by slumping demand for EVs and investor concerns about Musk’s extensive work with the Trump administration.
Tesla shares were up about 1% at $414 in early trading Tuesday. The stock gained 18% over the previous five days and came into today's session up 1.5% for the year. Tesla shares have staged a remarkable recovery after being down as much as 45% from their end-2024 level in April.
Below, we take a closer look at Tesla’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching.
Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Signals Upside
Tesla share broke out from a four-month symmetrical triangle last week, setting the stage for a continuation move to the upside. Importantly, above-average volume has accompanied the recent buying, indicating conviction from larger market participants.
Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator also flashes extreme overbought conditions, heightening the chances of near-term pullbacks.
Let’s identify a crucial overhead area on Tesla’s chart to watch if the shares extend their rally and also point out major support levels worth monitoring.
Crucial Overhead Area to Watch
If Tesla shares continue to gain momentum, investors should watch how the price responds to the $489 level. This area on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock’s all-time high in December.
It’s worth noting that this location also closely matches an upside measuring principle price target, which calculates the percentage change of the symmetrical triangle near its widest section and adds it to the pattern’s top trendline value at the breakout point.
For example, we apply a 37% increase to $357, which forecasts a target of $489.09, implying a near 20% gain from Friday’s closing price.
Major Support Levels Worth Monitoring
During retracements in the stock, it’s initially worth monitoring the $367 level. The shares could encounter buying interest in this location near the top of the symmetrical triangle and a brief countertrend high in February during the stock’s strong downtrend earlier this year.
Finally, Tesla bulls’ failure to successfully defend this major level could see the price revisit lower support around $330. Investors may place buy limit orders in this region near the closely aligned 50- and 200-day moving averages, which sit positioned near a trendline that stretches back to last November.

Jonas, who last week pitched TSLA as Morgan Stanley’s top idea at the 13th Annual Laguna Conference, believes the company remains ""out of favor"" with many institutional investors.
At the conference, he noted only five out of 120 attendees owned Tesla shares ""in size,"" contrasting with a previous conference in Japan where zero out of 200 attendees owned the stock.
Morgan Stanley attributes Tesla’s potential to its role in the ""emerging field of physical AI,"" arguing it has the ""largest addressable markets"" among the so-called ""Mag 7"" tech giants.
A key factor for Morgan Stanley is Elon Musk’s role as a ""talent magnet."" The firm believes his long-term commitment is ""critical for attracting and retaining the world-class AI and robotics talent needed to execute Master Plan 4.""
Despite criticism of Musk’s proposed $1 trillion compensation package, Morgan Stanley states that if the required milestones are met, ""we do not think Tesla shareholders will complain.""
Morgan Stanley’s note also highlights recent product improvements. Jonas, who recently replaced his five-year-old Model Y, noted the new vehicle’s ""material improvements in FSD (v13.2.9) with HW4"" and a buying process that was ""easier than buying a bicycle.""
However, the analyst calls having Grok, X’s virtual assistant, in the car the ""biggest ’upgrade,’"" describing the in-car experience as ""a highly immersive and entertaining experience.""

Its shares have dropped 45% in 2025, reaching a calendar-year low of $214 in April.
And even though share prices bounced back in recent days/weeks/months, they are still down for the year, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't very optimistic about the short-term outlook.
Tesla has another rough earnings report
In its July 23 Q2 earnings report, Tesla posted a 16% decline in quarterly sales for the second straight quarter. The automaker also saw year-over-year declines in both revenue and vehicle deliveries.
Musk stated back in July that the company could have a few ""rough quarters,"" highlighting tariff-related cost increases and the expiration of the tax credit as contributing factors. The company plans to limit vehicle inventory for Q3, and is uncertain whether it will be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed after August.
Musk, who was an advisor to President Donald Trump until May, when he resigned, stated in April that he believes lower tariff rates are beneficial for ""prosperity."" While Tesla is a U.S. manufacturer, it imports various car parts from multiple foreign countries that are currently impacted by tariffs, including battery cells from China.
The end of the EV tax credit
First introduced in 2009, the federal EV tax credits were implemented as incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase electric vehicles. The current credit for a new EV purchase is $7,500, while used car purchases can receive $4,000.
However, now that Congress has passed President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" those credit incentives will expire on Sept. 30. Consumers who have their car delivered after Sept. 30 will still receive the credit, provided the purchase occurs before the deadline.
In 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS reported that the government spent more than $2 billion in federal tax credits for more than 300,000 electric vehicle purchases. There's a strong chance that consumers will capitalize on the expiring credits, causing EV sales to spike briefly in September and then drop.
A study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in October 2024 predicts that if the credits are eliminated, EV sales in the U.S. will fall by nearly 30%.
Tesla's share price increased in August
The EV company's stock price climbed 9% in August, marking a second consecutive month of price increases. But it has a lot of catching up to do, as share prices are currently down by 16% in 2025 in the first week of September. It's been over eight months since Tesla stock reached an all-time high, peaking at $488 on Dec. 2, 2024.
Competitors such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors will also be impacted by the tax credit elimination, but have their gas vehicle production to fall back on. Ford's share price was up by 18% in 2025, as of early September, while GM's increased 17%.
Is Tesla stock a buy right now?
While Tesla stock has been trending upward in recent months, macroeconomic factors like ongoing tariff disputes and a presidential administration that is actively rolling back EV initiatives make the stock a potentially volatile investment.
Once investors understand how Tesla plans to manage production after tax credits expire, they'll be able to make a more informed decision about the stock's long-term value within their portfolio. And there's a strong chance the stock will bounce back once President Trump is out of office. But for now, investors should wait for the next earnings report before purchasing shares."

On Sunday, Anthony Scaramucci fueled speculation about a potential Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)–xAI merger. The SkyBridge Capital founder said on X that it ""feels inevitable"" as Elon Musk ramps up efforts to integrate artificial intelligence into his companies.
Scaramucci's post came after the Wall Street Journal reported that Stephen Hawk, a 56-year-old Tesla investor from Florida, had submitted a shareholder proposal urging Tesla's board to authorize an investment in xAI.
Musk supports Tesla investing directly in xAI, his AI startup behind the Grok chatbot. ""Will Tesla and xAI merge? Feels inevitable,"" Scaramucci wrote.

The proposal, included in Tesla's proxy filing alongside a controversial $1 trillion pay package for Musk, will be voted on at the company's annual meeting on Nov. 6.
Hawk said he was inspired by Musk's posts hinting at collaboration.
""Formalizing this partnership is essential to ensure clear mutual benefits for both entities,"" Hawk said in an email.
Previously, Musk had also polled followers on X about the idea and told investors in July, ""We'll act in accordance with the shareholder wishes.""

Musk has described Tesla as an AI company at its core, focusing on what he calls ""real-world AI"" to power autonomous driving, robotics and the Optimus humanoid robot.
At the same time, xAI is developing large language models, including Grok, which is already integrated into Optimus and some Tesla vehicles as an AI companion.
Tesla and xAI also collaborate on energy needs, with xAI purchasing Tesla industrial batteries to power data centers. Musk has suggested a merger or investment could ensure Tesla investors share in the upside of his AI breakthroughs.
Earlier this month, Gene Munster, co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management, argued that combining Tesla with xAI could help the automaker reach an ambitious $8.5 trillion market capitalization.
Meanwhile, xAI is undergoing internal changes, laying off 500 generalist tutors while pledging to expand its specialist AI teams tenfold. The startup, valued at more than $100 billion, has also raised $10 billion in funding and is reportedly eyeing a valuation as high as $200 billion.

Trending Now:
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.
Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

On Monday, Wall Street had a good start to the week. The Nasdaq increased 0.8% and the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, both setting new records for the day. The Dow didn't move. Tesla (TSLA, Financials) rose 6% as reports suggested that Elon Musk bought about $1 billion worth of stock, which helped the consumer discretionary sector. Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) went up enough to reach a value of $3 trillion, making it a member of the mega-cap club with Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) fell as China stated its antitrust investigation would continue, but losses got less later in the session. Now everyone is watching the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. People think that the Fed will drop rates by a quarter point, but they will pay more attention to what Jerome Powell says about how far the Fed might go. Intel (INTC, Financials) surged about 4% after lowering its cost forecast. CoreWeave (CRVW, Financials) rose 6% after signing a $6.3 billion cloud agreement with Nvidia, although short-seller Kerrisdale Capital revealed a pessimistic bet. The markets are getting ready for one of the most important weeks of the year, with the Fed's decision and retail sales data coming up."

Stocks opened the week on a positive note Monday, with Tesla (TSLA, Financials) doing much of the heavy lifting.
The S&P 500 was up 0.4% by late morning, while the Nasdaq added 0.7% to notch fresh highs. The Dow hovered near flat. Tesla shares surged 6.6% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed he bought more than 2.5 million shares of his company, a purchase worth over $1 billion.
Analysts said Musk's move comes at a key moment as Tesla pushes deeper into AI and self-driving technology. Dan Ives of Wedbush called the robotaxi and AI opportunity a trillion-dollar door now opening for the automaker.
Meanwhile, attention is shifting to the Federal Reserve. Policymakers meet this week, and markets see a near-certain chance of a quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday. Bond yields edged lower ahead of the decision, with the 10-year Treasury at 4.04% and the 2-year at 3.54%.
Trade headlines also added to the mix. President Donald Trump said talks with China are going very well and predicted a deal soon. He plans to speak with President Xi Jinping on Friday.
On the economic front, the Empire State Manufacturing Index dropped to -8.7 in September, a sharp fall from August and well below forecasts, underscoring cooling momentum.
With Tesla's surge kicking off the week and the Fed on deck midweek, investors are bracing for what could be a defining stretch for markets in September."

Tesla shares jumping as CEO Elon Musk is buying up $1 billion in shares. That stock now turning positive for the year. My next guest has been watching the charts on the stock and he sees a possible breakout ahead. Join me now for a look at the key levels to watch with Tesla is Fairlead Strategies Senior Technical strategist Will Tamplin. Will, it is good to see you. So, Tesla in the green, we've wiped out the year-to-date losses. Uh we turned to you Will for that technical take. You look at the charts, what do you see ahead for Tesla Will? Is this one going to keep moving higher?
Good afternoon. Thank you for having me. Um, we do expect Tesla to uh keep moving higher. It pushed out of a uh triangle formation a few weeks back and those patterns are typically bullish uh when they resolve to the upside. Um, in this case, we do expect intermediate term upside follow through and we can um uh derive a price projection of around 500. and that's at the top of a long-term secular uptrend channel. Um that's really the next major resistance level on the chart. Um, we have seen an acceleration in upside momentum after that triangle breakout. We saw some brief consolidation, but really late last week is when we saw the momentum pick up for those that follow the MACD indicator. We've seen a positive divergence there to the upside. Um so everything everything in our work points to more upside fall through for Tesla looking out looking out a few months.
So Will, let let's say I'm watching this and you know, I'm looking for a pullback. Uh, where would the pullback in the stock be where where you would say that that would be a smart place to get in?
Sure. So, uh when we see gaps up like we saw today, they they sometimes can be exhaustive, um especially after the, you know, a few days of upside that we've already seen. Um, so today's low will mark the the top of that gap and then the bottom of the gap, which is near 396. Um, you know, if that gap fills pretty quickly, then that would indicate that there has been some exhaustion there and we would uh expect some short-term digestion and profit taking. Um and and if we see that short-term pullback, the next level for Tesla um is around 362. That's from the May high. So a former resistance level now turned into support."

Tesla disclosed that Musk purchased 2.6 million shares, worth roughly $1 billion, on Friday. Investors saw the move as a strong vote of confidence in the company as it leans into autonomous technologies such as robotaxis and humanoid robots.
The purchases came about a week after Tesla's board proposed a pay package for Musk worth almost $1 trillion. The compensation package lays out aggressive goals over a 10-year span, including the electric vehicle maker's robotaxi and humanoid robot businesses. The company also aims to lift its market cap to $8.5 trillion from roughly $1 trillion today.
Tesla stock has made a full recovery since sinking to a March low in the aftermath of a public fallout between President Trump and Musk, which later cooled off.
Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action
Tesla's robotaxi initiative and Musk's departure from politics have fueled shares of the company. The stock is up more than 70% since Musk officially left DC and subsequently paused a proposal for a third political party in the US.
The billionaire's early participation in Trump's presidency appeared to hurt the Tesla brand as electric vehicle sales plummeted in Europe.
Meanwhile, China's BYD (BYDDY) has eaten into Tesla's market share, while the expiration of EV tax credits in the US has also raised concern over the electric vehicle business.
Tesla has leaned into its robotaxis, which launched for the first time in June in Austin, Texas, with plans to start testing in Nevada soon.
Beyond autonomous driving, Musk has been touting Optimus humanoids as the next major catalyst for growth.
Musk has said Tesla will eventually derive 80% of its value from robots that he claims will help humans with everyday tasks, from cooking dinner to walking the dog to babysitting.
""Optimus is going to be the greatest product in the history of humanity,"" Musk said earlier this month on the ""All-In"" podcast.
Wall Street has 27 Buy ratings on Tesla stock, 19 Hold, and 5 Sell.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas recently reiterated his Overweight recommendation on the stock and price target of $410 per share, based on how much of the global labor market could be replaced by humanoid robots.
""We estimate converting just 1% of the US labor force to humanoid is worth approximately $320bn or $100 per Tesla share,"" Jonas wrote last week."

New York State manufacturing activity pulls back in September
Manufacturing activity in the New York Fed's region fell sharply in September.
The NY Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed the general business conditions index this month fell to -8.7 from 11.9 in August. This marked a retreat after two straight months of positive readings.
The index is calculated by taking the differential between those reporting better conditions and those reporting worse conditions; a little under half of the respondents to September's survey reported no change.
The headline retreat in conditions was driven by a sharp pullback in new orders and shipments, with both sub-indexes falling to their lowest levels since April 2024.
Some optimism remained about the outlook, however, with the index for future conditions coming in at 14.8 in September, roughly unchanged from the prior month.

Oracle rises as Trump hints at TikTok deal
Oracle shares rose roughly 5% before the market open on Monday as President Trump hinted that the US and China had reached a TikTok deal during trade talks in Madrid.
Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social: ""The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly. A deal was also reached on a “certain” company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""
That post came after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters outright that the US and China were ""very close"" to a TikTok deal.
ByteDance-owned TikTok faces a US ban unless it divests its ownership to a US- or US-allied country by Sept. 17.
Politico reported in March that the White House was considering a deal from Oracle to run TikTok. Others who've expressed interest in buying the social media company have included a group of investors led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr., Microsoft (MSFT), YouTuber Mr. Beast, and Perplexity AI.

Trump expects 'big cut' from Fed in pivotal week for markets
Stocks notched further record highs last week as investors bet the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates at the end of its meeting on Wednesday.
Markets are pricing in 100% odds of a rate cut, with the vast majority forecasting a reduction of 25 basis points. The debate now is how many more cuts are likely in 2025 — and whether the Fed just might go for a bigger move of 50 basis points.
Count President Trump in the jumbo-cut camp, going by his remarks to reporters on Sunday.
“I think you have a big cut,” Trump said on his way back to Washington. “It’s perfect for cutting.”
The Fed's call could determine whether the rally in stocks has room to run. That makes it pivotal for markets.
Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal and Jake Conley spell out what to watch:
Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) stock fell 2% before the bell on Monday following reports last week that Paramount Skydance (PSKY) is preparing a majority-cash bid for the media conglomerate.

Gold pushes back toward record with eyes on Fed rate-cut
Bloomberg reports:
Bullion traded near $3,640 an ounce, after gaining for four consecutive weeks. Traders see a quarter-point cut this week amid signs of labor market weakness, and some potential for reductions extending into next year.
That expectation has driven Treasury yields to the lowest in months, weakened the greenback and supported gold. Lower yields reduce the opportunity cost for holding the metal, while a weaker dollar makes it more affordable. Whether the central bank will challenge these bets is a key question for investors this week.
“Macroeconomic numbers are likely to take over from tariff-related headlines,” ANZ Group Holdings’ Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said in a note, meaning that investors are watching how US tariffs will impact the nation’s economic growth and inflation data.
Bullion has rallied nearly 40% this year, and recently broke out a spell of range-bound trading to surpass an inflation-adjusted record. Persistent uncertainty over geopolitics and Trump’s tariff agenda, and concerted central bank buying have provided support."

The American electric vehicle (EV) maker is said to be navigating a competitive landscape in Germany, where it faces intense rivalry from Chinese automakers.
Analysts have speculated that the political engagements of Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, may have influenced consumer demand, given his political endorsements.
Despite this, the company has signalled optimism, noting encouraging trends across all markets served by the Gruenheide plant, not just within Germany.
André Thierig, who manages the Gruenheide plant outside Berlin, told the German news agency: “We currently have very good sales figures and have therefore revised our production plans for the third and fourth quarters upwards.

According to the KBA road transport agency, Tesla’s sales in July experienced a significant drop, with 1,110 vehicles sold.
Furthermore, the sales tally for the period from January to July showed a 57.8% decline.
Tesla sold 384,122 cars in the second quarter (Q2), down around 60,000 cars, or 13.5% from the sales total a year ago, marking the company’s largest year-over-year sales decline to date.
It reported a 12% year-on-year decrease in total revenue for Q2 2025, with figures falling to $22.49bn from $25.5bn in the same period last year.

Billionaire Elon Musk is putting his money where his mouth is.
He purchased about $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, his first open market purchase of the electric vehicle-maker's shares since February 2020, regulatory filings show.
Musk bought 2.57 million shares on Sept. 12, paying between $372.37 and $396.54 per share, according to a regulatory filing on Sept. 15. The purchase is Musk's largest insider stock purchase ever by value and widely seen as a vote of confidence in the company by its outspoken chief executive.
The purchase comes at a critical time for the EV giant as it struggles with slowing car sales, shrinking market share and a backlash against Musk for his role in slashing government jobs during his time as head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk gave up his government job to refocus on Tesla and has pushed for greater control over the company. The company's board proposed just more than a week ago a $1 trillion compensation plan for Musk based on lofty financial and operational targets to address his demands. If approved, it would be the largest corporate pay package in history.
Musk's share purchase is ""the clearest signal yet that (Musk is) slamming the accelerator on being all in again ... the Tesla-Musk narrative looks firmly back on track after a shaky start to the year,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Around 1 p.m. ET, Tesla shares were up 3.07% at $416.22, after earlier reaching the highest level since mid-January.

As the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached new highs, Progress's performance illustrates a divergence, potentially highlighting investor caution amid its expansion into the public sector amidst a bullish market climate driven by anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts.
The recent creation of Progress Federal Solutions Inc. raises questions about its immediate impact on Progress Software's financial outlook. Despite the company's strategic push into supporting U.S. government digital transformation, its stock experienced a 3% decline amid broader market gains, hinting at potential uncertainties. Over the past five years, Progress's total shareholder return stood at 24.68%, reflecting growth despite the recent setback. However, performance over the past year has lagged, with the company underperforming both the U.S. market and the software industry.
The integration of ShareFile and SaaS acquisitions could bolster Progress's revenue and earnings, but any operational misstep might offset these gains. Analysts forecast Progress's revenue to grow to US$1 billion by 2028, with earnings reaching US$138.9 million. The current share price of US$41.94 reflects a significant discount to the consensus price target of US$70, indicating potential undervaluation if the company's plans succeed. Nevertheless, achieving these projections depends on the effective management of its new ventures and strategic acquisitions amidst macroeconomic risks.

Despite this development, the company's share price declined 4% last week. In contrast, major indices like the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit record highs amid optimism around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and positive moves in tech stocks such as Tesla and Alphabet. Intuit's price movement diverges from broader market trends, suggesting the launch had limited effect within the context of broader economic factors influencing investor sentiment.
Intuit has 1 warning sign we think you should know about.
The introduction of Clair On-Demand Pay by Intuit may signal a shift towards enhancing its payroll offerings, aligning with its broader strategy of AI and cloud integration to boost customer retention and cross-selling. However, the recent 4% decline in Intuit's share price suggests that this development had a limited immediate impact on investor sentiment, possibly due to prevailing market factors such as optimism around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts that have buoyed tech stocks like Tesla and Alphabet. Over the past five years, Intuit's shareholders have nonetheless experienced a substantial total return of 116.63%, indicating a robust longer-term performance despite recent market fluctuations.
When compared to the broader market over the past year, Intuit's performance was less impressive, underperforming both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which have been reaching record highs. Analysts' forecasts suggest that Intuit's revenue could grow by 12.7% annually over the next three years, with earnings expected to rise to US$6.2 billion. The recent product launch could potentially support these forecasts by diversifying revenue streams and increasing customer stickiness. However, risks such as sluggish growth in Mailchimp and international headwinds remain concerns that could affect these projections. With a current share price of US$646.03, there is a significant discount compared to the analyst consensus price target of US$819.73, suggesting potential upside if the company's growth catalysts align with analyst expectations.

The automaker removed the rear-wheel drive option from its website without warning as Cybertruck sales continue to slide
People hoping to get a deal on a Tesla Cybertruck are in for disappointment. The automaker has removed the rear-wheel drive (RWD) trim model from its website just five months after it debuted. The move comes as Cybertruck sales continue to slide.
Suggested Reading
That model carried a price tag of $69,990, but potential buyers who go to the Tesla site now will see the $72,490 all-wheel drive model as the base option. That price deducts the $7,500 federal tax credit, which will disappear on Sept. 30. The base vehicle price is $79,990.

The RWD Cybertruck, introduced in April, carried a lower price tag, but also lacked some features of higher-priced models, such as adaptive suspension, reduced towing power and payload capacity, and a backseat screen. However, it had an impressive 350 miles of range between charges.
Tesla did not respond to questions about why the model was removed from the website.
Excitement about the Cybertruck line has cooled considerably since the vehicle was launched. A report issued in July from Cox Automotive said Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks in the second quarter of 2025, a 50% drop from one year ago. Year to date, the company has sold just 10,712, which is 7% off of last year's pace. The looming end of tax credits is likely to further dampen sales, not only for Cybertrucks but for EVs as a whole.
“Lower EV sales last quarter underscore the market’s ongoing challenges, as growth in the auto business ebbs and flows on consumer demand,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox Automotive in a statement.
This comes as Tesla's board has offered Elon Musk a pay package worth up to $1 trillion, in part to keep him focused on the company, rather than other matters such as his announced alternative political party.
""We … believe the recent Musk new pay package was a relief for investors as this will confirm Musk stays CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 in our view as Musk remains the most important asset to Tesla,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors Monday."

Elon Musk bought $1 billion worth of Tesla shares after the company proposed a decade-long, trillion-dollar pay package, sending the stock higher Monday morning.
Suggested Reading
The billionaire bought the shares on Sept. 12, according to a regulatory filing, placing it on the same day Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm defended the pay plan, calling Musk a “generational leader.”

Shares in the electric car company jumped 7% in early trading in New York, putting its value 12% up so far this year. The stock has recovered from a 45% slump in early April.
The filing comes five years after Musk last bought Tesla stock in the open market, which was in February 2020. He sold more than $20 billion worth of shares in 2022, the same year he bought Twitter.
Earlier this month, directors proposed a 10-year pay package that could deliver Musk as much as $1 trillion in stock awards if the company clears a set of extraordinary performance hurdles.
The deal would grant Musk roughly 423 million Tesla shares, currently worth about $143 billion, but the full value only materializes if Tesla executes on the series of ambitious targets.
The purchase amounts to a show of confidence in Tesla’s prospects after a challenging first half of the year in which vehicle sales slumped 13% worldwide. While Musk has talked up Tesla’s pursuit of robotaxis and humanoid robots, he’s also cautioned that the company could be in for “a few rough quarters” after the U.S. phases out electric-car purchase incentives at the end of this month.
The chief executive has also been increasingly preoccupied with politics and side projects, controversially heading President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency for part of this year. Some shareholders have openly pressed him to commit at least 40 hours a week to Tesla, worried that his forays into Washington and social media are draining focus at a time when execution is critical.
Denhom said on Sept. 12 that Musk’s political forays had not hurt the company. “What he does from a personal perspective, in terms of his political motivations, is up to him,” she said. “We’re in a democracy, so everybody gets to voice their points of view.”
The next day, Musk appeared remotely at a march in London organized by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. He said “violence is coming” to the U.K. and told attendees: “You either fight back, or you die.” His comments were condemned by a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer as dangerous.

Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Tesla, Chipmakers and Hims and Hers.
First up, we got Tesla. CEO Elon Musk buying a billion dollars worth of Tesla shares. The billionaire bought the stock indirectly through a revocable trust last week. That's according to a regulatory filing.
The outspoken CEO's last significant purchase of Tesla shares in the open market was in February of 2020. So this purchase marks Musk's largest insider acquisition ever by value according to Verity data.
Tesla shares this year have been weighed down by slumping sales, partly tied to Musk's political activities hurting the brand, along with the end of certain incentives for electric vehicles by the Trump administration. Those shares by the way, up more than 7. 1/2%.
Next up, we got chipmakers. China is launching two investigations targeting the US semiconductor industry. The Ministry of Commerce opened an anti-dumping probe related to certain American make analog IC chips. Those are the sort of products sold by companies like Texas Instruments and analog devices.
At the same time, the ministry also kicked off an anti-discrimination investigation into US moves against the Chinese chip sector. Meanwhile, Chinese mar- China's market regulator said that Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly law, according to her preliminary probe. All of this coming as the US and China meet for trade negotiations in Madrid.
China's market regulator on Monday said that Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly law. That's according to her preliminary probe. You can see all the stocks are down, but because this is sort of newer on the analog front, TI and uh analog devices is taking a bit of a bigger hit.
And finally, Hims and Hers, the FDA said a widely watched TV commercial from the telehealth firm earlier this year breached the agency's regulations. Now, the agency said the advertisement is an example of the industry's misleading advertisements. The FDA commissioner said online pharmacies are advertising drugs with only upsides mentioned, contributing to America's culture of over reliance on pharmaceuticals for health.
The ad in question promoted the use of its compounded version of Novo Nordisk's obesity drug Wagovi. I believe it played during the Super Bowl.

In a move that caught even the most jaded investors off guard, Elon Musk just scooped up $1 billion worth of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares through a revocable trust, marking his first open-market buy since 2020. The timing wasn't subtle. His purchase hit the tape the same day Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm went public defending a potential $1 trillion performance-based compensation package for Muska bold package that hinges on sky-high market cap and operating milestones. Denholm didn't mince words: only Musk, in her view, can lead Tesla into its next era.
That show of confidence seemed to do the trick. Tesla shares jumped as much as 7.3% in premarket trading, clawing their way back into the green for 2025. It's a sharp reversal for a stock that had been down 45% as of April, hammered by a 13% slump in global vehicle deliveries and fading U.S. EV incentives. While Musk has continued hyping Tesla's long gamerobotaxis, humanoid bots, next-gen AIhe's also warned of a few rough quarters ahead. That didn't stop him from putting real skin back in the game, after dumping $20 billion of Tesla shares in 2022 to fund his Twitter purchase.
The takeaway? Musk still bets big on Musk. With a net worth of $419 billion, he didn't need to make this movebut he did, and that's what matters. Whether or not the $1 trillion pay package is approved, this surprise buy signals renewed conviction in Tesla's long-term arc. For investors burned earlier this year, Musk's $1B bet might be the spark needed to believe again."

Sep 15 - A major insider move put Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the spotlight after Elon Musk disclosed a purchase of more than $1 billion worth of company shares. An SEC filing showed Musk bought 2,568,732 shares on September 12 at prices ranging from $371.38 to $396.54 per share. The total cost of the purchase was about $999.96 million. Following the transaction, Musk now owns 509,362,808 Tesla shares.
The move pushed Tesla stock higher, climbing 7% on Friday and another 8% in premarket trading on Monday to $419.50. The stock now trades near levels last seen in mid-January. Investors often read insider buying as a sign of confidence, though the purchase represents less than 0.1% of Tesla's total shares outstanding.
Alongside the stock purchase, Tesla's board granted Musk a performance-based compensation plan that could be worth up to $1 trillion if all 12 milestones are met. The package requires him to remain CEO for at least 7.5 years, with shareholders set to vote on the proposal at the company's annual meeting on November 6.

The central bank widely expected to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percent, but President Trump saying on Sunday he expects a big cut.

Reports say these conversations centered on TikTok, tariffs and the economy. President Trump just posting that the meetings have gone well and suggested a deal on TikTok could be done.
He'll also be speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.

- Elon Musk purchased some 2.57 million Tesla shares last week, sending the stock higher—and into positive territory for the year—in Monday trading.
- The CEO's investment was worth approximately $1 billion, according to regulatory filings.
- The move is seen as a sign Musk is more focused on Tesla and its move into artificial intelligence.
Shares of Tesla climbed Monday, lifted by the news that CEO Elon Musk purchased some $1 billion worth of the electric vehicle maker's stock.
Tesla's (TSLA) shares finished the day up 3.6% to around $410, pulling back a bit from earlier prices above $425. The move pulled them into positive territory for 2025; they finished last year around $404, and they haven't finished above that level since late January.
Musk, for his part, celebrated the rise with some of his characteristic humor, at one point observing on X that the shares were ""up $69 to ~$420 as foretold in the prophecy.""
Musk's purchases fueled the shares' climb. A regulatory filing showed Musk made 25 separate purchases last Friday totaling approximately 2.57 million shares for prices ranging from about $372 to $396. The stock closed Friday at $395.94.
The buys were seen by investors as a further commitment by Musk to Tesla, which has struggled this year with falling demand for EVs, and backlash from the CEO's work with the Trump administration in cutting government spending. The company earlier this month proposed a long-term pay package for Musk that could reach up to $1 trillion if Tesla meets certain milestones.
Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush, a longtime Tesla bull, wrote that the move ""is a huge sign of confidence for Tesla bulls and shows Musk is doubling down on his Tesla A.I. bet.""

The purchase, made Friday and disclosed in a filing Monday, represents a rare action – by Musk or any other CEO. Few business leaders use their own money to buy their company’s stock without exercising of options, which allows them to purchase shares at a fraction of their market price.
The news lifted shares of Tesla (TSLA) 7% at the market open Monday. While it didn’t sustain those early gains, it did finish the day up nearly 4%. That was enough to wipe out the remaining losses for Tesla shares for the year, which at one point were down 42% from the end of 2024.
“It’s a huge vote of confidence from Musk and the bulls love seeing this,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and one of the bigger fans of Tesla on Wall Street. “It sends a positive signal after a very tumultuous year for Musk and Tesla shareholders.”
That Musk could purchase $1 billion in stock mostly as a symbolic gesture is another indication of his massive wealth. The cost is affordable for the planet’s richest person. In fact, the rise in the stock’s value Monday added about $5.8 billion to his net worth, more than covering the cost.
A roller coaster year for Tesla shares
Shares of Tesla nearly doubled after the election, as investors bet that Musk’s close ties to then President-elect Donald Trump would help the company’s financial outlook, particularly its plans to focus on self-driving cars and develop a fleet of robotaxis. But after reaching a record high in mid-December, shares started to slide sharply.
As Musk became active in running the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, the company started facing backlash from those who opposed Trump and his agenda. Tesla posted its largest sales drops in history in the first and second quarter, and profits plunged along with it.
Beyond any political backlash hurting sales, the company is also facing increased competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, particularly in China. Chinese automaker BYD is set to eclipse Tesla as the world’s largest maker of EVs despite its cars not being available in the US market.
Tesla and other automakers face the end of a $7,500 tax credit for US buyers of EVs at the end of this month. While that is expected to lift third quarter Tesla sales, the EV company is likely to see a sharp drop for rest of the year.
And Musk had a falling out with Trump as he left his role in the administration and returned to Tesla.
However, Tesla shares have climbed off their lows from earlier this year. Musk and Tesla’s fans on Wall Street stress that the future value of company is tied to its self-driving technology and robotaxi plans.
Pay package could be worth $1 trillion
Last week, Tesla proposed a new pay package for Musk that could grant him additional stock options that could be worth $1 trillion should Tesla achieve certain sales and valuation milestones.
However, Musk will get no additional shares and no income from Tesla unless its stock increases by more than 50% to a market cap of $2 trillion. Its currently valued at $1.3 trillion. Last week, shares of Tesla increased 13% after the pay package was unveiled.
Tesla’s board, in its proxy statement last week, spoke of the importance of keeping Musk focused on Tesla going forward. He is also CEO of several other companies, including rocket company SpaceX and artificial intelligence company xAI, which owns the social media platform X he purchased for $44 billion in 2022. In addition to his many business interests, Musk remains active in politics, despite his falling out with Trump. He has announced plans to form a third political party, but details remain murky.
Musk continues to have many critics not only for his politics and divisive social media posts, but also his massive wealth and the influence it has bought him. Pope Leo XIV, in his first extensive interview since becoming the first American pontiff, cited massive CEO pay, specifically Musk and his proposed pay package, as a sign of the income inequality that he said is behind the polarization of society.
“What does that mean and what’s that about? If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we’re in big trouble,” he said in an interview Sunday with Elise Allen, senior correspondent at Catholic news site Crux.
Monday’s stock purchase brought an additional 2.6 million Tesla shares into Musk’s portfolio. But it barely increased his stake in the company – his holdings of Tesla shares rose by less than 1%.
Musk has purchased blocks of Tesla shares on the open market in the past, but most came from exercising his stock options that he received as compensation. The 413 million shares of Tesla he now owns represents 12.8% of the company’s shares.
But Musk has said he wants to control at least 25% of the company. He has threatened to shift some of his AI efforts away from Tesla to xAI without more control.
“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X in January 2024. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.”

Well, our first ticket today is Tesla. The stock is up it big time today. Shares rising more than 6% powered by a surprise move from Elon Musk.
Must disclosed that he bought roughly 2.57 million new shares worth about $1 billion through a trust over the weekend.
This boosts his direct holdings excluding options to around 413 million shares.
Investors are reading into this as a strong vote of confidence, especially as Tesla has been under pressure from slowing demand, competitive headwinds and concerns about profit margins.
The move also comes as Tesla rallies towards an eight-month high.
So, that's Tesla, a big jump today after Musk's big purchase reinforced those thoughts.
Okay. Moving on, our second trending ticker is Pop Mart, and they're the maker of the viral Labubu dolls and it's losing steam.
And it's no child's play for traders either who are losing big on the stock this morning.
Pop Mart shares dropped nearly 9% in early trade today in Hong Kong before pairing some of those losses ending up ending down around 6%.
That means Pop Mart has lost roughly $13 billion dollars, about a quarter of its market value since its peak at the end of August.
Though it's still up over 180% year to date.
Well, what's behind the drop?
Well, analysts led by J.P. Morgan downgraded the stock to neutral and cut its target price by around 25%,
saying that the resonance of the Labubu charm is fading. Demand is cooling, resale prices are falling, and production costs, well, they're on the rise.
Pop Mart has been diversifying and launched other newer toy lines.
They have done reasonably well, but haven't come close to matching the Labubu pop culture buzz.
And finally, Open Door is standing out again this morning in pre-market.
We keep seeing big swings here. Shares are up around 6% now after closing down just under 14% on Friday.
But overall, shares of the real estate platform have been rallying on leadership changes in the past few days.
Open Door shares are up by more than 1,400% in 3 months, and a lot of that growth has been fueled by social media chatter and meme stock momentum.
But now that co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu just rejoined the board and former COO Caz Najafi becomes CEO, there are some fundamental changes ahead.
The stock tumbled on Friday after co-founder Keith Rabois made public comments calling the company bloated.
He said the workforce of 1,400 is far more than needed, that the company needs to cut 85% of its workforce, and remote working culture had broken internal systems."

""I predict minimal investment in his current product, except in the area of self-driving tech.""
Peak Tesla? You know what they say: When it rains, it pours, and investors have been in the middle of a thunderstorm all year. Tesla has hit a number of speed bumps, including backlash facing Elon Musk and his political tour, declining sales and profits, the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit and disappearing zero-emission credit sales, mounting lawsuits, increased competition from advanced and affordable Chinese vehicles -- you name it, it probably went against Tesla's favor.
So, is it finally time to give up on Tesla?
Not so fast
There's no question Tesla is in a transition period of sorts, evolving from the electric vehicle (EV) maker investors knew and loved into a robotaxi operator offering ride-hailing services at low prices -- and potentially a robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) company to boot.
Right now, Tesla's focus has zeroed in on a couple of different developments. First, the Cybercab is set for production in 2026, and Musk has previously said it will serve the robotaxi fleet and go on sale with a sub-$30,000 price tag at retail. It's a dedicated two-door autonomous vehicle that allegedly won't have human controls, such as steering wheel or foot pedals, per the company at its 2024 unveiling.
That said, Tesla has made a habit of overpromising and underdelivering, which has set up a healthy amount of skepticism. ""I have to think that autonomy is further away than a lot of people expect,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, according to Automotive News. ""By 2030, you're still going to have a steering wheel and a driver. Even in Teslas.""
Tesla's primary goal with the Cybercab is simply to create a robotaxi with the lowest cost per mile of operation -- a simple idea that will be easier said than done. Through efficiency, slower acceleration, and lower top speed, among other factors, Tesla hopes to achieve a target cost of under $0.30 per mile of operation.
What else is in store?
Aside from the Cybercab, Tesla still has other developments to focus on in the near term. These developments include a plan to address affordability by launching a stripped-down Model Y crossover during the fourth quarter, which could help offset the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit.
It's not quite a new Tesla model with a sticker price around $25,000, as has been promised in the past, but shifting plans to modify current models for affordability rather than create a new nameplate was likely the right move -- Tesla needs to be more competitive on price, and quickly.
Tesla is also planning a second-generation Roadster, which was first promised to be in production as long ago as 2020, but is now expected within the next couple of years. Last, and perhaps least, Tesla is opening a factory next year dedicated to its often-forgotten Semi tractor trailer.
What it all means
While investors might have raised an eyebrow at that staggering announcement Tesla dropped on the market about a new compensation agreement for Elon Musk, potentially worth up to $1 trillion, the truth is that Tesla needs the best version of Elon Musk over the next decade. Tesla faces slowing sales in key markets, consumer backlash in the U.S. and Europe, and intense competition in China that has swallowed foreign automakers whole amid a brutal price war.
Tesla has its work cut out for it, no doubt. But if Musk can refocus his priorities on Tesla, even if it costs the company in compensation, it could position the EV maker to evolve more over the next decade than anyone imagined possible -- think robotaxi services, robotics, and AI.
We could be watching the beginning of a slow-motion train wreck, or the beginning of one of the best investments in our lifetime. Because the latter is still possible, it's not yet time to give up on Tesla."

Shareholders have gained tremendously, despite a volatile ride. If you'd invested $500 in this EV stock five years ago, here's how much you'd have today.
Buying what Musk is selling
Tesla has registered monster growth throughout its history. This key factor is what has propelled the stock to new heights. Shares have accelerated 185% higher in the past five years (as of Sept. 10). This would've turned a $500 starting sum into $1,424 today. This is despite the fact that the stock currently trades 28% below its peak from December 2024.
Anyone who follows the business knows that the market buys what founder and CEO Elon Musk is selling. Yes, Tesla sells well-designed and tech-forward EVs. Based on the stock's incredible performance, however, investors are convinced that the company will one day find huge success with autonomous driving and robotics. This could boost Tesla's finances.
Tesla: Back to reality
Introducing a global robotaxi fleet or selling lots of humanoid robots to customers is far from a certainty, though. But Tesla shares, which trade at a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of 201, reflect flawless execution in the years ahead. It's safe to say that the stock is overvalued.
And this is at a time when the company is struggling mightily. Revenue is down. In August, Tesla's market share of new EV sales in the U.S. was the lowest since 2017. And margins are taking a hit.
Investors can't complain about the trailing-five-year return. However, the next five years might not be so kind."

Over the last five years, Broadcom is up over 925% and Oracle is up over 475% -- outperforming every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla) except one -- Nvidia.
The ""Ten Titans"" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Combined, these three companies have nearly the same market cap as Apple, and are gaining increasing influence in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%). In fact, the Ten Titans now make up 39.1% of the index compared to 33.7% for the Magnificent Seven.
Beyond the market cap influence of these names, Broadcom and Oracle embody groundbreaking advancements in cloud computing, infrastructure software, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Here's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now.
Broadcom is a balanced way to invest in AI
Broadcom and Oracle's surging stock prices illustrate how AI is redefining previously stagnant investment theses. Just a few years ago, both companies were often viewed as dividend-paying stalwarts.
Broadcom was known for its established semiconductor business, providing the nuts and bolts behind networking, broadband, wireless, cybersecurity, and more. But the company is completely different today due to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 and the development and adoption of its AI chips.
Cloud computing giants are lining up to buy Broadcom's AI chips, known as XPUs. XPUs are highly advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are tailored to a specialized function and are especially good at handling increasing AI workloads. Broadcom doesn't just design the chips, it also makes associated networking products, like Tomahawk switches that link chips within a server rack, and Jericho Ethernet fabric routers, which enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers.
Broadcom is unique because it is far bigger than just an AI play. Rather, it is a highly diversified company that benefits from the buildout of AI infrastructure, AI software, and the growth of high-speed connectivity.
Oracle is heavily disrupting incumbent cloud giants
Oracle's latest quarter perfectly represents why Broadcom has become a behemoth that is closing in on $1 trillion in market cap. On Sept. 9, Oracle said that its cloud infrastructure segment is expected to grow 77% in fiscal 2026, 78% in fiscal 2027, 128% in fiscal 2028, and 97% in fiscal 2029 to become a $144 billion business. If Oracle comes remotely close to these estimates, its cloud business will become far larger than its legacy database services segment.
Like Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. But Oracle is now a completely different company. Its strength comes from its competitive pricing model, which makes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) a great add-on for customers that use its database services.
Oracle is an enterprise-facing company. Whereas investors in the ""big three"" cloud players, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are getting a lot of moving parts that have nothing to do with cloud computing. In this vein, Oracle has become one of the best ways to invest in high-octane cloud growth, somewhat similar to how investors are drawn to Nvidia. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.
Broadcom and Oracle's stock prices are running up far faster than they are growing earnings because investors are buying these stocks for where they could be years from now rather than where they are today. Forward earnings estimates will probably increase as analysts adjust their targets based on recent results and guidance. But for now, Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a staggering 54.8 compared to 48.2 for Oracle. For context, Nvidia's forward P/E is 39.5 -- meaning investors are even more excited about Broadcom and Oracle's growth.
Broadcom and Oracle are moving markets
The breakneck growth rates and size of Broadcom and Oracle prove why it's time to forget the Magnificent Seven and use the Ten Titans as a better descriptor for market-moving growth stocks. Even folks who don't own the Ten Titans outright may be indirectly impacted through their holdings in index funds and exchange-traded funds.
In addition to their foundational role in the major indexes, the Ten Titans will likely make or break broader market sentiment. If the S&P 500 keeps making new highs, it's probably because of the Ten Titans. If it undergoes a major sell-off, it's probably because a few key Titans fell. You may have even seen headlines about how the S&P 500 is expensive relative to its historical valuation. That's because many of the Ten Titans are valued more for their future earnings than their current profits. So investors should only approach these stocks if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe these companies can deliver on highly optimistic expectations.
It's also worth noting the correlation that these companies can have. For example, Oracle's blowout quarter sent Broadcom and Nvidia soaring on Sept. 10 because Oracle is a major customer of these chip makers. Increased AI spending to build out OCI benefits Broadcom and Nvidia. Although Oracle may account for less than 2% of the S&P 500, its results had a significantly larger impact on the S&P 500 than the movement in its stock price alone."

Denholm, who was also on the special committee that put the compensation proposal together, argued that Musk needs to be motivated by extraordinary challenges tied to extraordinary compensation. At the same time, she suggested he’s less interested in the additional wealth that the promised Tesla shares would represent, and more in the voting power.
“I think it’s a little bit weird talking about the dollars when it’s actually the voting influence,” said Denholm, whom The Times described as “occasionally appearing ill at ease” during the interview.
It might also seem counterintuitive to offer such a massive pay package when Tesla’s profits and vehicle sales are falling, but Denholm insisted that the plan is about “future performance.”
“It’s not about past performance,” she said. “He gets nothing if he doesn’t perform against the goals.”
As TechCrunch previously noted, the package’s goals are considerably less ambitious than some of the promises Musk has made about Tesla in the past."

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-13T20:00:00,"Did Tesla Just Say ""Checkmate"" to Uber and Lyft?",Early download data of Tesla's Robotaxi app indicate the company is gaining momentum in the ridehailing arena.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0791bbd6d69f754664d715f622dab0ad3f36eb732271630f0167f32b3c4a1201,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/did-tesla-just-say-checkmate-to-uber-and-lyft/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/did-tesla-just-say-checkmate-to-uber-and-lyft/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/did-tesla-just-say-checkmate-to-uber-and-lyft/,fool.com,200,,"Elon Musk has an undeniable knack for commanding the spotlight. Whether it's airing political opinions online, veering into philosophical tangents during earnings calls, or setting -- and often missing -- ambitious timelines, Musk reliably captures global attention.
This summer, Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) finally unveiled its long-anticipated ridehailing service -- dubbed robotaxi -- in Austin, Texas. As a longtime Tesla investor, I'll admit my initial reaction was mixed. Given Musk's hype campaign, the launch felt narrower in scope than I had expected, leaving me questioning the true maturity of Tesla's autonomous driving systems.
That said, my concerns have eased -- at least for now. The ongoing rollout of robotaxi is more than just a new source of revenue for Tesla. If this business is successful, it represents a transformative shift for the company from an electric vehicle (EV) pioneer to a more sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) platform. In the long run, Tesla's execution could put serious pressure on Uber (UBER 0.35%) and Lyft (LYFT -0.65%).
What does robotaxi mean for Tesla?
Not long ago, many on Wall Street dismissed Tesla's ambitions in the self-driving car market as little more than a moonshot bet with slim odds of success. Yet after years of accumulating real-world driving data through its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, Tesla has built and continuously refined its autonomous driving system -- leveraging cutting-edge hardware from companies like Nvidia.
This progress matters because it helps reframe Tesla's identity from a disruptive automaker to a sophisticated technology company. More importantly, successful deployment of FSD and robotaxis has the potential to unlock recurring revenue streams that are far more durable and higher margin than one-time vehicle sales.
Who does Tesla compete with in the autonomous driving market?
Tesla is far from the only company pursuing self-driving vehicles. Alphabet's autonomous car division, Waymo, currently operates in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Austin, with plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C. in the near future.
Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft still rely primarily on human drivers. That said, Uber has struck a number of strategic partnerships with competing autonomous vehicle developers as it seeks to eventually build its own autonomous vehicle fleet and compete more directly with Tesla.
While Uber and Lyft may lack Tesla's technological edge, they retain one major advantage: deeply entrenched global customer bases. This makes customer acquisition yet another hurdle for Tesla, alongside the regulatory challenges of scaling robotaxi services into new cities.
Even so, early adoption data demonstrates Tesla's ability to generate meaningful reach despite a crowded and intense market. A new report published by Ark Invest highlighted that downloads for the Tesla Robotaxi app have been soaring relative to Uber and Waymo by a considerable margin.
As illustrated in the chart below, this strong start underscores Tesla's ability to capture attention and attract customers, even in a market dominated by incumbent providers.

Has Tesla made a checkmate move against ridehailing incumbents?
Personal ridehailing services are somewhat commoditized. As a longtime user of both Uber and Lyft, I rarely notice a meaningful difference in quality between the two; my choice usually comes down to whichever is cheaper or arrives faster.
For Tesla to convince riders to try its robotaxis, it will likely need to compete aggressively on price and undercut incumbents. At first glance, this approach might seem like a tough path to make the business profitable. But this is where the unit economics of Tesla's autonomous driving system prove transformative.
Uber and Lyft bear the cost of paying out commissions to human drivers on each ride. By contrast, Tesla-owned robotaxis will keep the ride fare. In effect, each ride is a high-margin transaction that can help accelerate payback periods on investments related to Tesla's AI and autonomous driving initiatives.
The bigger challenge lies in scaling the robotaxi fleet. While initial adoption metrics are encouraging, Tesla's ridehailing footprint is small at the moment. Moreover, expansion into new geographies may not translate into accretive business results right away. It could take years for riders to switch platforms en masse, especially to a service that is predicated on a still nascent technology that continues to face scrutiny around safety and reliability.
I am far more optimistic about Tesla's robotaxi prospects than I was just a few months ago. While Tesla has opened the chess match with a strong move, it's premature to call this a ""checkmate"" situation against Uber and Lyft, though."
finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-13T18:31:00,Why I Can't Stop Thinking About Ford's Next $5 Billion Investment,The company's big bet says a lot about where the auto industry is heading.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=afbfe7b807e526ec0b7d575c7eba78969ebe9d03f4eb6c91dcdd24d066ef87be,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/why-i-cant-stop-thinking-about-fords-next-5-billio/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/why-i-cant-stop-thinking-about-fords-next-5-billio/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/why-i-cant-stop-thinking-about-fords-next-5-billio/,fool.com,200,,"If Ford's (F 0.86%) recently announced $5 billion investment in creating the ""Ford Universal EV Platform and Ford Universal EV Production System,"" looks like an all-in bet on electric vehicles (EVs) and sounds like one, it's a pretty safe assumption that it is one. It's a bold move, and makes perfect sense in light of CEO Jim Farley's long-term strategic decision-making.
However, the move's significance extends beyond Ford and speaks directly to investors in EV stocks such as Tesla (TSLA 1.39%). Here's why.
Ford's big bet is the right move
It's no secret that EVs are winning market share in car sales, and that all the major car companies are pursuing the market. It's the growth area of the auto industry, and Ford's investment serves to confirm several key factors that investors need to consider when making decisions about the EV sector.
- If an automaker isn't relevant in the EV sector, then it's not relevant in the auto market.
- Despite a slowdown in EV investment in recent times, automakers will need to invest in EVs to produce new models and capture market share in a growing market.
- Ford's emphasis on ""affordable, high-quality electric vehicles,"" with the first breakthrough product planned to be a ""midsize four-door electric pickup with a targeted starting price of about $30,000"" and getting to customers in 2027, highlights the importance and opportunity inherent in reducing the upfront cost of an EV.
- The claim that Ford will produce vehicles with ""lower cost of ownership over five years than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y"" highlights who is actually winning in the EV market right now. It's Tesla.
Ford's emphasis on affordability and cost of ownership is an implicit recognition of a critical point in the evolution of the auto industry, namely, the upfront cost of an EV. It's sometimes mistakenly viewed as a challenge, but the evidence suggests it's actually much more of an opportunity.
Let's put it this way. If the cost of fueling and maintaining an EV is markedly less than that of an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, then a reduction in the upfront price of an EV will have a disproportionately positive impact on the total cost of ownership of the vehicle.
Instead of thinking of EVs as suffering a competitive disadvantage to ICE vehicles due to a higher upfront cost, investors should consider the opportunity to reduce production costs (and subsequently the upfront price) and how that could increase sales volumes. However, to enter the virtuous cycle of low prices leading to a significant increase in sales volumes, which can then result in decreased production costs per unit and ultimately more sales or margin expansion, automakers must invest in EV production -- exactly what Ford is doing.
Why Ford's decision confirms the case for Tesla
Ford's news confirms a large part of the investment thesis for Tesla. Ford doesn't have the dominant market position of Tesla; Ford currently sells almost seven times fewer EVs in the U.S. than Tesla. And it's highly unlikely to close the considerable gap without this sort of investment.
On the other hand, Tesla's more than 46% share of the U.S. EV market gives it the scale and brand recognition to produce affordable cars and sell in volume. CEO Elon Musk appears to have misstepped in releasing a refreshed Model Y in 2025 rather than a lower-cost Model Y -- an argument supported by the strong sales growth of the budget-friendly Chevrolet Equinox this year.
Still, Tesla has a lower-cost Model Y planned for the fourth quarter; this is, at least in part, a reaction to the market trends this year. In addition, Tesla's robotaxi concept is an integral part of maximizing the lower running and maintenance costs of EVs by operating them more frequently, either via dedicated robotaxi vehicles (Cybercab) or converted Teslas in the future.
Where next for Ford?
While Ford's decision is the right one, there's no guarantee it will work, and Ford's track record (Ford's Model e segment lost $5 billion last year) isn't great. Still, that doesn't mean Farley isn't correct in taking this path -- it just means it's a risky but necessary bet. It would be much riskier not to invest in developing EVs.
That said, I can't help but think that the same logical process that leads to that conclusion also leads to an awareness that Tesla is much better positioned in the EV market and is several steps ahead of Ford."

This move, combined with strategic executive appointments, highlights the company's focus on enhancing its retail presence. Despite a reported 205% share price increase last quarter, Curaleaf faced declining revenue and an increasing net loss in Q2 2025. This mixed performance resonates with broader market trends, where tech stocks like Tesla led gains in a mostly positive market environment. This expansion and engagement could have influenced investor sentiment positively during the period.
Curaleaf Holdings has 1 risk we think you should know about.
Curaleaf Holdings' expansion into Westerville, Ohio, enhances its retail footprint and aligns with its strategic growth initiatives. These developments, in conjunction with recent executive appointments, are positioned to potentially influence the company's revenue trajectory positively. As Curaleaf looks to bolster its presence domestically and internationally, these strategic moves could translate into improved future earnings, given the anticipated market penetration in regions like Germany and Turkey. The opening of the new dispensary in Ohio reflects the company's commitment to increasing its market share, which might support revenue growth projections of 4.3% annually over the next three years.
Over the past year, Curaleaf's shares have experienced a total return decline of 15.91%. This downward trend contrasts with the company's more recent positive share price performance, such as the reported 205% increase in the last quarter. Despite the disappointing longer-term performance, it stands out against a challenging market environment. Curaleaf underperformed compared to the broader Canadian market, which returned 21.8% over the past year, but outpaced the Canadian Pharmaceuticals industry, which saw a 22.5% decline.
With the current share price at CA$3.33, it remains approximately 15% below the consensus price target of CA$3.83, suggesting limited upside potential based on analysts' expectations.

Despite the broader market showing a weekly gain of 1.6%, TELUS's stock movement has remained relatively flat over the past quarter. This stability aligns with the mixed performance observed across major U.S. indexes where, despite some tech stocks such as Tesla soaring, other sectors demonstrated more modest gains. Events like TELUS's introduction of Wi-Fi 7 and strategic partnerships with companies like FreeTelecom could have added weight to the broader market trajectory during this period.
We've identified 3 risks for TELUS (2 are a bit unpleasant) that you should be aware of.
The introduction of the latest iPhone models by TELUS, coupled with strategic moves like Wi-Fi 7 and partnerships with FreeTelecom, positions the company to potentially boost its consumer engagement and market presence. Such initiatives could positively impact revenue and earnings projections as TELUS expands its broadband and digital health offerings. These areas are crucial for driving recurring revenues and diversifying beyond core telecom services.
Over the past five years, TELUS has achieved a total shareholder return of 24.62%, indicating moderate long-term growth. While the company has managed to surpass the Canadian Telecom industry's 1-year return of 14.3%, it has yet underperformed the Canadian market’s overall growth of 21% over the same period. This highlights both its strengths and areas where it may face challenges compared to broader market performance.
With consensus analyst price targets valuing TELUS stock at CA$23.38, the current share price of CA$22.10 suggests a modest discount. This slight undervaluation implies potential for upward movement should TELUS successfully capitalize on current initiatives and meet growth expectations. However, as the target reflects only a small premium over the present share price, investors and analysts consider TELUS fairly priced, assuming consistent operational performance.

His comments, often hyperbolic, consistently capture far more attention than the standard rhetoric from corporate executives. Over the past several years, Musk has articulated a vision to evolve Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) beyond its roots as an electric vehicle (EV) and energy-storage company into a broader technology platform centered on artificial intelligence (AI).
At the heart of this strategy is Tesla's push toward fully autonomous driving. While robotaxis dominate the conversation around Tesla's AI roadmap, there is another opportunity quietly flying under the radar that could carry even greater implications: Optimus, the company's humanoid robotics project.
What once sounded like science fiction is slowly becoming a legitimate, tangible reality. Industry leaders such as Nvidia's Jensen Huang have pointed to the multitrillion-dollar potential at the intersection of AI and robotics. Musk has gone even further, asserting that Optimus could one day account for 80% of Tesla's value once the platform is scaled.
For investors, this raises an important question: Is Optimus another example of Musk's grandiose promises, or could it really become Tesla's most impactful product ever?
Why are humanoid robots important in the broader AI narrative?
In recent years, much of the progress in artificial intelligence has come from the development of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating detailed, context-rich answers to user queries. While these systems have boosted efficiencies across certain workflows, they remain fundamentally reactive -- waiting for prompts before offering value.
This limitation highlights why humanoid robotics is such an ambitious frontier. Unlike traditional industrial robots, humanoid robots are built with arms, legs, and advanced dexterity, enabling them to perform human-level tasks in real-world environments.
In many ways, humanoid robotics represent the closest manifestation of achieving generalized intelligence -- AI that doesn't just respond but actively engages with the physical world.
What companies does Tesla Optimus compete with?
Thanks in part to Musk's star power, Optimus has become an increasingly recognized prototype in the humanoid robot landscape. However, Tesla is far from alone in pursuing this technology.
Boston Dynamics -- backed by Hyundai -- continues to show off mobility and agility capabilities through its humanoid robot platform, Atlas.
Meanwhile, Figure AI -- a start-up backed by AI heavyweights such as Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, and Jeff Bezos -- is building a competing humanoid system with an initial focus on manufacturing and logistics applications.
Could Optimus really account for 80% of Tesla's future value?
Today, Tesla's revenue and profitability are largely driven by its EV and energy-storage businesses. Optimus introduces an entirely new frontier: labor automation. Designed as a general-purpose worker, Optimus has the potential to support manufacturing and production on factory floors while also handling routine tasks in household settings.
The implications are twofold. Internally, deploying Optimus in its gigafactories could yield significant labor efficiencies -- lowering operating costs and expanding profit margins as vehicle production scales. Externally, commercialization unlocks the doors to penetrating new markets such as logistics, retail, and healthcare -- all areas where reliable labor needs are rising.
Unlike vehicles, which remain commoditized products subject to cyclical demand, Optimus could become a recurring, mission-critical asset for businesses seeking to offset labor shortages or inflationary costs. If successful, this would provide Tesla with a much-needed durable growth engine beyond its legacy auto and energy solutions.
This is why Musk contends that Optimus could ultimately become Tesla's largest business. Recurring demand and the high-margin nature of robotics have the potential to dwarf even the most optimistic scenarios for Tesla's car business, which will always face shifting consumer preferences and intense competition from other automakers.
If Tesla executes on its robotics pursuit, the upside could be enormous, potentially reaching $10 trillion, according to Musk. With that said, Optimus should still be viewed largely as a moonshot. The product remains years away from global adoption and is unlikely to move the financial needle for Tesla anytime soon."

Real estate mogul and entrepreneur Grant Cardone is doubling down on a message he’s been pushing for years: college isn't worth it for most people. In a recent post on X, Cardone laid out seven reasons why he believes a degree won't make you rich—and may even hold you back.
From Debt To AI: Why College No Longer Delivers
“College degrees are not worth the cost,” Cardone said plainly. He pointed to skyrocketing tuition costs, low graduation rates, oversaturation of degree holders, and the rise of artificial intelligence as reasons why people should reconsider the traditional path.

First, he said it's simply too expensive: “$60K for private colleges,” Cardone wrote, noting that the middle class is drowning in $1.7 trillion in student loan debt. Second, it takes too long. “46% have not graduated at the four year mark,” he said, highlighting the high dropout rate.
He also argued there’s a glut of degrees: 48% of Americans now hold an associate degree, but many remain unemployed. “Plenty of unemployed smart people,” he wrote. He believes the trades offer better opportunities, since they don't require degrees and suffer from major labor shortages. “The greatest shortage of jobs are the trades,” Cardone said.
Even for those who graduate, many are underemployed. “41% of grads work at job that do not require a college degree,” he added.
Then there's the threat from artificial intelligence. ""AI is replacing long expensive education providing the elaborate research without a book, a classroom, or a teacher and do so in minutes,"" he warned.

Lastly, he pointed to shifting employer requirements. Cardone said many tech firms and banks have stopped requiring college degrees.
""To get rich in America, I do not need a college degree,"" Cardone told “VladTV” last year. He added that while Ivy League degrees might be worth it due to the high-paying jobs they often result in, for most people, the debt just isn't worth it.
He compared student loan debt to modern-day slavery, saying it traps people financially. He also criticized the way the education system pushes college as the only path to success, especially in minority communities."

You are not alone. When it comes to resource giants, Glencore has always been a lightning rod for both bullish bets and cautious sidesteps. Whether you are holding or watching from the sidelines, recent price swings have definitely given investors something to talk about. Over just the past week, shares have moved up 5.8%, hinting at renewed optimism in the market. Zooming out a bit, the last 30 days have seen a more modest gain of 2.5%, but if you have been around for the ride this year, you know it has been a rocky one, with the stock still down 16.3% since January.
Looking at longer-term performance, Glencore’s story is mixed. Investors who have held on for the past year are looking at a decline of 17.3%, and the three-year drop of 28.3% is hard to ignore. However, step even further back and the stock has actually outperformed over five years, posting a strong 115% gain. Some of this volatility has been tied to ongoing market developments, such as shifting commodity prices and evolving views on the transition to clean energy. These macro trends seem to be changing how investors think about Glencore’s risk and reward moving forward.
But is Glencore undervalued? That is the real question, and it is exactly where our analysis comes in. Out of the six key valuation checks we use, Glencore passes four. That gives it a solid valuation score of 4. Before you take any action, let’s break down what those checks are and what they actually mean for you as an investor. Keep in mind, there is an even better way to evaluate Glencore’s value that we will get to by the end.
Why Glencore is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: Glencore Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates the value of a company today based on its expected future cash flows by projecting them forward and then discounting them back to the present to account for risk and the time value of money. For Glencore, this approach provides a helpful lens on the company's long-term earning power.
Currently, Glencore generated $987 million in Free Cash Flow (FCF) over the last twelve months. Analysts forecast a rise in FCF over the next several years, with estimates suggesting around $4.15 billion in 2029. While analyst projections cover only the next five years, further cash flow estimates are extrapolated beyond that point to round out the model. All figures are denominated in US dollars, which is Glencore's reporting currency.
Based on these projections, the model arrives at an intrinsic fair value of $2.39 per share. Comparing this with the current share price, the DCF analysis implies Glencore is trading at a 26.8% premium to its estimated value. In other words, the stock is considered overvalued based on its future cash flow outlook."

Shares are down about 9% year to date, and analysts expect the company's sales to shrink 5% in 2025. For years, Tesla has been the world leader in sales for battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). That could change in 2026 due to one exciting EV stock.
BYD should finally outsell Tesla
Last year, Tesla sold 1.79 million battery powered electric vehicles. Chinese automaker BYD (BYDDY 2.30%) came in second, selling 1.71 million EVs. Importantly, BYD also sold more 2.33 million plug-in hybrid EVs, a style of vehicle that Tesla doesn't even sell. But when it came to pure electric vehicle sales, Tesla remained on top.
Notably, General Motors came in third place with just under 900,000 battery-powered EVs sold last year -- roughly half of what Tesla and BYD sold. This left Tesla and BYD as the heavyweights in the global EV market, with Tesla just barely on top.
But that could all change this year, given Tesla's struggles. As its sales shrink -- deliveries are down 13% through the first half of the year -- BYD is guiding for battery powered and hybrid EV sales to grow about 7%.
Factoring in these expectations, it's likely BYD will replace Tesla as the leading global seller of battery-powered EVs within the next few quarters. But is the stock a buy?
Right now, Tesla shares trade at a lofty price-to-sales ratio of 14. BYD stock, meanwhile, trades at less than 1 times sales. Why the huge discount?
""Most of Tesla's sky-high value is based on robotaxis and robots it hasn't yet produced,"" notes one Reuters report. BYD, meanwhile, garners most of its valuation from its existing business -- not hype for future products. Then, there is the risk that Chinese regulations could alter BYD's profitability or business model at any time.
BYD stock is priced at a discount, but investors must do their due diligence before jumping in."

The Technicals
From a charting perspective, Tesla has quietly built a strong base with a series of higher lows over recent weeks. The stock has held its 200-day moving average and that resilience has drawn traders' attention.
Tesla has already begun to rally, gaining more than 12% in the last two days alone.
The Catalyst
There's a catalyst ahead that could propel Tesla even higher: the third-quarter deliveries report due Oct.2.
The consensus estimate on Tesla's Q3 delivery numbers is conservative, with expectations sitting at the lower end of historical ranges.
See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Nathan said the upcoming delivery report could surprise to the upside as EV credits set to expire on Sept. 30 have likely pulled forward demand, leaving Wall Street underestimating the quarter's true strength.
A surprise to the upside on Q3 deliveries could provide another powerful pop for Tesla’s stock.
The Sentiment
Sentiment also plays a central role in Nathan's bullish call.
After months of skepticism about whether Tesla's growth story had peaked, the mood around EVs appears to be shifting.
With Tesla's technical setup aligning with a likely interest rate cut next week—and traders underweight heading into the Q3 delivery report—Nathan argues the risk-reward is weighted favorably to the upside.
He summed it up as a rare moment where both the technicals and sentiment appear to align, setting Tesla up for a powerful rebound.

(Reuters) -Electric car rivals BYD and Tesla are set to be the biggest losers from Mexico’s proposed 50 percent tariff on autos imported from China, triggering a likely blow to the fast-growing electric car market in Mexico while sparing the traditional ""Big Three"" U.S. car manufacturers.
The proposed tariff, announced on Wednesday, targets electric and gasoline cars imported from all countries that Mexico doesn’t have a free trade agreement with, including South Korea, India, Indonesia and Russia. In practice, however, the tariff would mostly impact electric cars manufactured in China and sold in Mexico, industry analysts said.
The levy has the potential to reshape North America's fastest-growing car market and put the brakes on BYD’s meteoric rise in Mexico, analysts said.
Over the last year, Mexico has raised tariffs on Chinese-manufactured electric vehicles from 0 percent to 15 percent and now 50 percent, said Eugenio Grandio, president of the Electric Mobility Association in Mexico.
“It’s definitely a game-changer,” Grandio said. “Fifty percent [tariff] is a very aggressive number.""
The plan still needs to be approved by Mexico’s Congress, where President Claudia Sheinbaum’s Morena party has a significant majority.
While the proposed tariff appears to be sweeping in nature, it would actually spare legacy U.S. automakers – General Motors, Ford and Stellantis – under a 2003 decree.
That regulation allows car companies with production plants in Mexico to import a percentage of vehicles tariff-free from countries like China that don’t have a free trade agreement with Mexico. Unlike Tesla and BYD, all three legacy U.S. carmakers have production plants in Mexico.
Meanwhile, plans by both Tesla and BYD to set up operations in Mexico have stalled. Tesla suspended construction of its factory in northern Mexico last year, blaming interest rate pressure and a slowing global economy. The proposed factory was projected to be the largest Tesla factory in the world, creating up to 6,000 local jobs.
All of Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y cars that were sold in Mexico since mid-2023 were manufactured in the company’s Shanghai factory, said Salvador Rosas, vice president of the Tesla Owners Club in Mexico, a Tesla-affiliated enthusiast's group that collects vehicle identification numbers from members.
Grandio said Tesla likely has a stockpile of cars already in Mexico, which would give it some cushion to try to pivot and import cars from different factories in other parts of the world.
Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment about the proposed tariff."

US stocks closed out a winning week mixed on Friday as Wall Street took stock of the US economy from a lofty, record-setting perch ahead of the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated decision on interest rates next week.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed around 0.5% to notch its fifth-consecutive record as Tesla (TSLA) stock hit a seven-month high. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell just below the flat line, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.6%.
Still, the Dow gained nearly 1% for the five trading sessions through Friday, its first win in three weeks, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their best showings since early August.
Investors have taken in several weeks' worth of economic data to gain clues on the Fed's next move. Over the last week, jobs data has shown clear signals of labor market weakness, with just over 20,000 jobs added last month and weekly initial jobless claims surging to a near four-year high.
Meanwhile, inflation remains stubborn, with consumer prices rising last month amid more signs that President Trump's tariffs are filtering their way into the economy.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey released Friday showed consumer sentiment slipped more than expected in September, while long-run inflation expectations jumped to 3.9%, as Americans worried over the effects of tariffs.
But investors are betting inflation is tame enough for the Fed to cut next week — and then some.
Traders are pricing in a more than 90% chance of a quarter-point cut when the Fed holds its September meeting, according to CME Group. Beyond that, around 75% are betting the central bank will cut the equivalent of three times before the end of the year.

Nasdaq notches fifth straight record, Dow falls to close the week
The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hit its fifth straight record Friday as tech stocks continued to gain amid renewed AI optimism.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell as Wall Street took stock of this week's US economic data ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week.
The Nasdaq climbed nearly 0.5% to close above 22,149. The Dow (^DJI) fell 0.4% after closing above 46,000 for the first time Thursday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dipped below the flat line. All three major indexes had rallied to records on during the previous trading session.
Despite the Dow's loss Friday, the index saw its first weekly gain in three weeks, up roughly 1%. For their part, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw their best weekly performance since early August, as did the Technology Sector (XLK).

Gemini Space Station stock pops over 40% in trading debut
Crypto exchange Gemini Space Station (GEMI) began trading on the Nasdaq on Friday afternoon.
The stock opened at $37.01, 32% above its initial public offering price of $28 per share. Shares continued to soar, reaching $40 as of 2 p.m. ET.
The crypto brokerage firm led by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss raised $425 million, putting its valuation at about $3.3 billion. According to Reuters, the IPO was 20 times oversubscribed, indicating strong demand for crypto companies.
""The market sentiment is incredible,"" Gemini COO Marshall Beard told Yahoo Finance earlier today. ""I think with the regulatory landscape, especially here in the United States, being very positive for the crypto industry, folks are excited. Folks are building projects again, they're launching new things. More people are coming into the industry.""
Last year, Gemini made $142 million in revenue, and the crypto brokerage boasts more than $21 billion in assets on its platform. But the company has been grappling with mounting losses: In 2024, Gemini recorded a net loss of $158.5 million, and in the first half of 2025, that widened to a net loss of $282.5 million.

Black Rock Coffee Bar stock jumps 34% in public debut
Black Rock Coffee Bar (BRCB) made its public debut on the Nasdaq on Friday.
Shares opened at $26.50 under the ticker symbol BRCB after the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company initially offered 14.7 million shares at $20 each.
The company raised $294 million in the initial public offering. The coffee chain currently has 158 locations stretching from the Pacific Northwest, where it was founded in 2008 in Beaverton, Ore., to Texas. It started with a drive-through model, but now 75% of locations also have a lobby for customers to sit and stay.
""We have all the components of a Dutch Brothers,"" CEO Mark Davis told Yahoo Finance about the company's competitive advantage. ""If you think about the drive-through only, we have the order ahead with the app, and then we have third party that can order.""
""Then secondarily, we have this lobby and ... when you think about the magic behind our brand, it's certainly the baristas and the way that they engage,"" he added.
In the second quarter, same-store sales increased by 10.9% from a year ago.
This is the first coffee chain to go public since Dutch Bros (BROS) went public on the New York Stock Exchange in September of 2021. That stock is up around 100% since it went public at $23 per share.
Black Rock Coffee Bar joins a list of recent IPOs. This week, companies including Legence (LGN), Figure Technology, and Klarna (KLAR) debuted on the public markets, and the crypto exchange Gemini (GEMI) is also set to begin trading on Friday. Other IPOs earlier this year include Chime (CHYM), Circle (CRCL), Figma (FIG), eToro (ETOR), and Bullish (BLSH).

Tesla leads 'Magnificent 7' after approval for robotaxi testing in Nevada
Tesla (TSLA) stock continued to lead the ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks in early afternoon trading Friday as the EV maker was granted a new permit from Nevada’s Department of Motor Vehicles to test its robotaxis in the state.
Shares climbed as much as 7% to $395 and were on track to close at their highest level since Jan. 31.
Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) stock gained more than 2% after settling an EU antitrust probe and reaching a tentative deal to revise its partnership with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).
Apple (AAPL) shares rose 1.6%, extending yesterday's gain despite being hit with two downgrades from Wall Street analysts at D.A. Davidson and Phillip Securities Thursday. The stock was still set to lose 2.7% for the week after the company unveiled its iPhone 17 lineup.
Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) climbed fractionally, and Amazon (AMZN) fell less than 1% after the tech giants were probed by the FTC over their Search advertising practices. Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) also rose fractionally.

Cryptocurrencies rise amid rate cut confidence
Cryptocurrencies climbed on Friday and were on track for weekly gains.
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose less than 1%, while ethereum (ETH-USD) jumped 3.6%. Solana (SOL-USD) spiked 5.4%. XRP (XRP-USD) and BNB (BNB-USD) rose more than 1.5%.
Bitcoin and ethereum were set for weekly gains of 3% and 6%, respectively, while solana was set to add nearly 12%.
The moves come as investors await the Federal Reserve's September meeting next week, when the central bank is expected to cut interest rates.
Crypto stocks were also largely positive for the week. Robinhood (HOOD) was on track to add 14%, Coinbase (COIN) 8%, and Circle (CRCL) nearly 10%. Strategy (MSTR) and PayPal (PYPL) were set for losses of about 1% and 2%, respectively.

The Technology Sector (XLK) was also on track for its biggest gain in five weeks, set to add 3.1% for the week, just as Tesla (TSLA) stock eyed a seven-month high on Friday.
For its part, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was on track to add 1.1%, its best showing in three weeks. The index closed above 46,000 for the first time on Thursday but fell just below that level Friday.

Vaccine stocks tumble on report that Trump plans to link child deaths to COVID shots
Vaccine makers' stocks tumbled on Friday after the Washington Post reported that Trump health officials are planning to link 25 child deaths to COVID-19 vaccines, alarming scientists.
Moderna (MRNA) shares fell more than 7%, while Pfizer (PFE) sank more than 3%. BioNTech (BNTX) stock tumbled 10%.
The health officials plan to include the claims in a presentation to a panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control as it considers new COVID vaccine recommendations, the Post reported. The outlet said the move alarmed scientists who say the vaccines have been studied extensively.

Tesla stock set to notch 7-month high
Tesla (TSLA) stock continued an upswing on Friday amid broader gains for technology stocks. Shares were up more than 5% in intraday trading and set for a roughly 11% weekly gain.
The stock is set to notch a seven-month high. The last time shares closed above their current level was Feb. 4, when shares hit $392.
That gain comes even as Tesla's share of the EV market is sliding, per the latest figures from Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book, and despite news of an engineer quitting as he pointed to CEO Elon Musk's “seriously compromised” leadership.
The engineer, Giorgio Balestrieri, wrote in a LinkedIn post Thursday: “This is not just about politics: it’s about lying to the public, manipulating public discourse, targeting minorities and supporting climate change deniers and political forces aligned with the oil and gas industry.""
Meanwhile, Wall Street has applauded Tesla's expanding energy business. Wolfe Research analyst Emmanuel Rosner and William Blair's Jed Dorsheimer published bullish notes on Tesla's energy storage segment after the company unveiled new battery storage systems earlier this week.
Dorsheimer said the new products contributed to his ""bullish thesis on the [Tesla's] energy storage business.""
Rosner wrote in a note Thursday that Tesla's Energy revenues could potentially reach $28 billion and that the business's rapid growth is ""critical for TSLA to avoid meaningful cash burn.""

Warner Bros. Discovery stock jumps amid report that Paramount is eyeing bid
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares surged 9% Friday after a report from The Wall Street Journal said that Paramount Skydance (PSKY) is preparing a majority cash bid for the media company.
The bid would be for the whole company, including its cable networks and movie studio, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The news comes after Warner Bros. Discovery said earlier this year that it will separate into two publicly traded companies by mid-2026, splitting up its streaming and studio assets from its global television networks business. Paramount's move is an attempt to pre-empt a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio business, the Journal reported.
Paramount Skydance shares climbed more than 2% following the news. Paramount and Skydance Media formally completed a merger in August.

Consumer sentiment slips as Americans worry over Trump's tariffs
Consumer sentiment slipped more than expected in September as Americans worried over the effects of Trump's tariffs.
University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey released Friday showed the headline consumer sentiment index came in at 55.4 for the month, a lower reading than the 58 projected by economists polled by Bloomberg and down from 58.2 in August.
The director of the University of Michigan's consumer surveys, Joanne Hsu, said about 60% of Americans polled provided ""unprompted comments about tariffs during interviews, little changed from last month.""
""Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation,"" she said.
Meanwhile, Americans' long-term inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years rose to 3.9% in September, ahead of the 3.4% projected by economists polled by Bloomberg and the long-term inflation expectations of 3.5% in August. Hsu noted that the reading is still ""considerably lower"" than the 4.4% in April.
Year-ahead inflation expectations were steady from the previous month and in line with economists' estimates at 4.8%.
The report comes a day after August's CPI report showed inflation ticking up in that month, revealing the sting of Trump's tariffs on consumer prices. Still, a recent slew of jobs data showing a weakening US labor market is expected to dominate the Fed's decision to cut rates in September, though questions remain about how steep the cut will be and how many additional cuts lie ahead.
Correction: This post was updated to reflect that the consumer survey showed preliminary results for September, not August.

Morgan Stanley forecasts a faster pace of rate cuts through January
Investors are convinced there's an interest-rate cut coming in September. The debate now is how big wiill it be, and what happens after that?
Morgan Stanley has put down its marker, saying Friday that it expects the Federal Reserve to lower rates four times in a row: at its three remaining meetings this year, then in January. All will be quarter-point moves, the brokerage said, even as some traders start leaning toward a jumbo cut to kick off.

Stocks waver at the open, but set for weekly gains
US stocks were muted on Friday at the open as Wall Street looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated decision on interest rates next week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell more than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank below the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) edged up 0.1%. The gauges meandered after rallying to records on Thursday, which saw the Dow close above 46,000 for the first time.
The major stock indexes are all headed for weekly gains of over 1.4%, with the Dow set for its first win in three weeks.
Now, investors are looking to the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment for September — due at 10 a.m. ET — for insight into Americans' inflation expectations.

Winklevoss-led Gemini IPO priced at $28 per share
Gemini Space Station, a crypto exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is set to go public on Friday to cap a week of IPO activity.
The company priced its initial public offering at $28 per share on the Nasdaq late on Thursday, putting Gemini's valuation at $3.3 billion. According to Reuters, the IPO was 20 times oversubscribed, indicating strong demand for crypto companies. The stock will begin trading under the ticker GEMI.
Meanwhile, shares of blockchain platform Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR) are set to begin their second day of trading by taking a leg lower. The stock, which opened at $25 per share on Thursday, spiked as much as 48% in initial trading and closed the day 24% higher at $31 per share.
Figure raised $787.5 million in its IPO, valuing the company at $5.3 billion. In an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi, Figure co-founder Mike Cagney explained why there's market excitement around crypto and how it's disrupting financial markets.
Buy now, pay later firm Klarna (KLAR), which debuted on the public markets on Wednesday, was up 2.5% in premarket trading on Friday after a down day on Thursday. The stock closed its first day of trading 16% higher and its IPO raised $1.37 billion.

RH stock falls after furniture company highlights dire tariff situation
Luxury furniture maker RH (RH) cut its annual outlook on Thursday, warning of the toll tariffs are having on the industry. The stock fell 9% in premarket trading.
""There's going to be gross margin headwinds from tariffs coming,"" CEO Gary Friedman said on the earnings call. ""You just can't raise prices fast enough, and there's only so much room our manufacturing partners have [to absorb costs].""
Friedman said that tariff uncertainty led the company to delay a new brand extension and its Fall Interiors Sourcebook.
As a result, RH said it expects a $30 million hit to profits in the second half of the year. The company also lowered its full-year revenue growth outlook to 9% to 11% from 10% to 13% previously.
Earnings per share of $2.62 missed Wall Street estimates of $3.25 per share. Revenue also missed: $899 million compared to $905 million estimated.
Year to date, RH stock has faced significant pressure and is down 42%.

Sep 12 - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares climbed about 7% on Friday to $395, the highest level since February, after the company expanded its energy storage offerings.
At an event in Las Vegas earlier this week, Tesla introduced its Megapack 3 battery unit alongside a new large-scale system called the Megablock. The Megablock integrates multiple Megapacks with power system components in a pre-engineered design intended to cut costs and speed up installation for utility projects. Production of Megapack 3 will begin in Houston late next year.
The launch comes as Tesla's energy unit gains traction. Revenue from energy generation and storage rose 18% year over year to $5.5 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025, offsetting an 18% decline in automotive revenue during the same period. The business has become a more meaningful contributor as electric vehicle sales soften.
Tesla shares have rallied 15% over the past month, with much of the gain tied to this week's product updates. The company's market capitalization now stands at about $1.2 trillion, keeping it among the largest U.S. listed firms."

(Reuters) -Tesla, the electric vehicle company led by billionaire Elon Musk, was accused in a lawsuit on Friday of favoring visa holders over Americans when making employment decisions so it can pay less.
According to a proposed class action filed in San Francisco federal court, Tesla violates federal civil rights law through its ""systematic preference"" to hire visa holders, and fire U.S. citizens at disproportionate rates compared with visa holders.
The complaint said Tesla is dependent on holders of H-1B visas for skilled workers, including in 2024 when it hired an estimated 1,355 visa holders while laying off more than 6,000 workers domestically, ""the vast majority"" believed to be U.S. citizens.
Tesla, based in Austin, Texas, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit was brought by software engineer Scott Taub and human resources specialist Sofia Brander, who said Tesla refused to hire them after learning they would not need sponsorship for employment, an indication they were U.S. citizens.
Taub said he was dissuaded from seeking one job after being told it was for ""H1B only,"" and not invited to interview for a second job. Brander said Tesla wouldn't interview her for two jobs though she had twice been a contract employee.
""While visa workers make up just a fraction of the United States labor market, Tesla prefers to hire these candidates over U.S. citizens, as it can pay visa-dependent employees less than American employees performing the same work, a practice in the industry known as 'wage theft,'"" the complaint said.
Friday's complaint quoted a December 27, 2024, post on X by Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born and raised in South Africa and has held an H-1B visa.
""The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,"" Musk wrote.
It is unclear how the plaintiffs plan to show Tesla's alleged systemic discrimination in hirings and firings.
Daniel Kotchen, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined additional comment.
The lawsuit seeks damages for all U.S. citizens who applied for Tesla jobs in the United States and were not hired, or worked for Tesla there and were fired.
The case is Taub et al v Tesla Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 25-07785.

This broader market rally, together with a general anticipation of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, might have buoyed investor confidence not just in mega-cap tech giants but also in firms like Jamf. While specific company events weren't the focus, the market's positive tech sentiment likely supported JAMF's substantial upward trajectory.
We've identified 1 possible red flag for Jamf Holding that you should be aware of.
The recent remarkable share price surge of Jamf Holding over the past month, coinciding with the tech rally, underscores favorable sentiment towards tech stocks like JAMF, buoyed by market conditions highlighted earlier. Despite this boost, it's essential to consider the broader context where the company experienced a 40.19% total return decline over the last year, pointing to the challenges that remain amid volatility and competitive pressures in the tech sector. Compared to the US market's 19.1% rise and the US Software industry's 26.4% gain over the same period, Jamf's recent gains mark a positive shift, albeit from a low base.
Forecasts may be influenced by this recent momentum in the stock price, presenting potential positive impacts on revenue and earnings projections, though it remains crucial for Jamf to navigate risks associated with Apple’s ecosystem and market competition. Analysts have set a price target of US$14.2 for Jamf Holding, reflecting a 35.8% premium to the current share price of US$10.55, highlighting optimism regarding the company’s future performance despite existing profitability challenges. Investors may find this target encouraging, representing a significant upside potential if Jamf continues its growth trajectory and successfully mitigates existing risks.

Uncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward.
The recent 7% decline in ACV Auctions' share price could indicate investor concerns or uncertainties that may affect its long-term growth narrative. Over the past three years, the total shareholder return, which considers both share price and dividends, has been 12.28%. This performance suggests that despite current fluctuations, the company's long-term growth trajectory has been somewhat positive, though it may not be in line with analysts' more bullish expectations.
In the last year, ACV Auctions underperformed compared to the US market's 19.1% return and the US Commercial Services industry's 2.7% return. This underperformance might reflect market skepticism about ACV's ability to overcome challenges like dealer volume softness and fierce competition. The overall market optimism, driven by anticipated interest rate cuts and strong tech stock performance, contrasts ACV's situation, possibly influencing analysts to re-evaluate revenue and earnings forecasts.
ACV Auctions' shares are currently priced at US$10.33, which is significantly below the consensus analyst price target of US$19.73. This suggests a broader disconnect between investor sentiment and analyst expectations. If the current market environment results in revenue growth challenges or slower-than-expected earnings improvements, it may necessitate revised analyst forecasts. Keeping an eye on these developments will be crucial for stakeholders considering ACV's potential to realign with its estimated fair value and achieve its growth goals.

The collective investor confidence towards tech stocks likely contributed to the upward momentum in Duolingo's share price, aligning closely with the positive performance trends observed in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.
Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Duolingo you should know about.
Duolingo's recent 13% share price increase, while reflecting broader tech sector optimism, could align with the company's expansion into new markets and educational categories. This aligns with Duolingo's ongoing efforts to broaden its user base through targeted international growth and AI-enhanced user engagement strategies. Over the longer three-year horizon, Duolingo has achieved a 203.45% total return, indicating robust performance compared to the US Market return of 19.9% in the past year. This highlights the company's capability to stay ahead of industry momentum, particularly within the tech-oriented sectors.
The latest market sentiment could bolster analysts' forecasts of annual revenue growth at 23.7%, pushing Duolingo towards its targeted earnings of US$368.7 million by 2028. However, the ongoing share price, now at US$309.34, still presents a discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$456.74. This discount reflects potential investor apprehension about achieving the ambitious growth figures set against competitive pressures and regulatory hurdles. Despite these concerns, Duolingo's three-year performance and forecasted growth metrics serve as a testament to its potential to capitalize on a rapidly evolving digital education space.

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) is in the spotlight again because Giorgio Balestrieri, one of the company's long-time engineers, departed and openly questioned Elon Musk's leadership. Balestrieri, who worked at Tesla for eight years, said that Musk's decisions have made the company's mission weaker and even endangered democratic institutions. He said in a statement about why he was departing that Musk's leadership was ""seriously compromised."" While he was at Tesla, Balestrieri helped build the Autobidder platform. This program makes it possible for energy storage systems to trade in real time. His departure is important because Tesla's mission now covers more than simply electric cars; energy software is becoming a major part of it. Balestrieri also touched about politics, suggesting that Musk was cooperating with those that are against the global energy revolution. Musk and Tesla haven't said anything. Tesla is now working on a variety of various things, like making robots, AI, and electric cars. Investors will be watching to see if Balestrieri's departure signals that other staff are departing as well, especially in Tesla's energy sector. When Tesla reports its quarterly numbers, that will be the next test. At that point, management will probably be asked about hiring, running the company, and how it plans to keep up with its sustainable energy targets."

Shares of the electric vehicle maker, up about 19% this month through Friday's close, are on a roll. Though it's been bumpy, Tesla (TSLA) stock has climbed off year-to-date lows around $222, seen in March, and is approaching break-even. (The stock, which finished last year near $404, ended the week just below $396, down roughly 2% year-to-date.)
The recovery is notable for a stock that, as of the end of the first half of the year, was the laggard of the Magnificent 7. It was (and still is) one of only two companies in the big-tech grouping in the red, Apple (AAPL) being the other, tailing all three major U.S. indexes. (The Roundhill ETF that tracks the Magnificent 7 group, known as ""MAGS,"" is up almost 16% this year.)
The stock has likely been boosted by factors that have lifted stocks broadly. Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates next week, a move generally seen as beneficial to big tech companies. Strong second-quarter earnings growth has offered a measure of optimism to investors attempting to gauge the strength of the economy. (Though there's plenty of concern on that score, too.)
But Tesla-specific factors also seem to be lifting the shares. Despite wariness about the health of the company's EV business, some investors appear willing to pay up for the possibility of a big opportunity in robotics, as well as for signs of progress in autonomous driving at both Tesla and more widely. A costly public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, while not extending valuable EV credits, has apparently cooled.
And Tesla's board has offered CEO Elon Musk a pay package that could remove a ""Will he stick around?"" overhang from the company's outlook—albeit at a high price. (Further enthusiasm for the stock may be attributed to what some see as potential for a ""short squeeze"" in which investors who traded against the shares have to buy it as it rises to cover short bets.)
Wall Street analysts don't appear ready to climb aboard en masse. Visible Alpha tracks about as many combined bearish and neutral ratings as bull calls, while its mean price target around $327 is substantially below current levels. Investors are, nevertheless, driving ahead.

Investors might be reacting to news from the company earlier this week regarding its energy business.
Tesla's growth engine isn't currently from EVs
Earlier this week, Tesla held an event in Las Vegas to introduce new products from its energy storage business, and it included a bit of a surprise. Its next-generation Megapack 3 energy storage system was introduced as expected. But the company also unveiled the new Megablock.
The Megablock combines several Megapacks along with electrical power system components. It's a pre-engineered system that Tesla says will lower costs and installation times for large-scale energy projects. Mike Snyder, Tesla's VP of energy and charging, also said that Tesla plans to build Megapack 3 in Houston starting late next year.
Tesla's energy storage business is thriving even as its electric vehicle (EV) sales are slumping. Energy generation and storage revenue jumped 18% year over year to $5.5 billion in the first half of 2025. At the same time, automotive revenue declined by 18%.
Tesla shares have rallied 15% over the last month. Much of that happened this week after the Las Vegas presentation, which was also streamed live on Tesla's X social media account. Investors had mostly been focusing on the potential of Tesla's robotaxi when it is launched in volume.

Instead, the stock seems to be getting bid higher in line with Tesla's recent gains, as CEO Elon Musk has been talking up Tesla's robotics program as its electric vehicle business fizzles. Emerging technology stocks in areas like quantum computing, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles, and solid-state batteries have all soared in recent months, and investors appear to be looking for a start-up with exposure to robotics and seeing Serve Robotics as a good candidate.
At 10:44 a.m. ET, the stock was up 9.3% after gaining 6.8% yesterday. At the same time, Tesla was up 5.4%.
Additionally, multiple quantum computing stocks were up double digits, showing investor interest in emerging stocks is mounting.
What's happening with robotics
Earlier this month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X that ""80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus,"" referring to the company's autonomous robot, which is still in development.
That enthusiasm and prediction could be enough to send some investors flocking to Serve Robotics, even though it doesn't have a relationship with Tesla.
However, any interest in robotics is likely to benefit the company, which works closely with Uber Eats to deliver food from a range of restaurants.
What's next for Serve Robotics
Serve Robotics is still essentially a development-stage business with revenue in its latest quarter of $642,000. That was up 37% from the quarter a year ago, but its net loss also more than doubled to $20.9 million.
With a market cap of less than $1 billion, there's plenty of room for Serve to move higher if investor enthusiasm pushes it that way, but the fundamental case for the stock is still thin at this point."

""What he does from a personal perspective in terms of his political motivations is up to him,"" Denholm said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. ""From a politics perspective, obviously we're in a democracy, so everyone gets to voice their points of view.""
Shares of the company were up nearly 7%.
Denholm's statements come days after Tesla's board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Musk, in what would be the largest corporate pay package in history, underscoring the hold he has over the carmaker as it attempts to transform into an AI and robotics powerhouse.
Musk's foray into party politics and his willingness to challenge President Donald Trump has heightened concerns among Tesla investors and analysts about potential distractions and hurt sales as alienated buyers chose rival EVs.
The board, however, has recommended shareholders, during an annual meeting next month, vote against a proposal to implement a policy to ensure political neutrality and prohibit the company and its leadership team from endorsing any political party.
Musk has continued to court controversy with his statements and garnered criticism for lack of content moderation on his social media platform X. On Wednesday, he blamed ""the left"" for the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk the day he was killed, before a suspect had even been identified.
The EV maker's board has repeatedly voiced confidence in Musk's ability to steer the company in a new direction while reigniting growth, even as it loses ground to Chinese rivals in key markets amid softening demand.
Denholm, who was hand-picked by Musk to run Tesla's board, has often been criticized for being beholden to the billionaire and failing to hold him accountable.
Musk spearheaded Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at cutting government spending, before he pulled back his involvement in late May.

Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 5.9% in the morning session after the stock extended its positive momentum on a wave of positive news including growing optimism around its autonomous driving technology.
Investor optimism was bolstered by advancements in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and the expansion of its robotaxi ambitions, highlighted by official approval from the Nevada DMV to start testing autonomous vehicles on public roads. Additionally, the company launched its new Megapack 3 and Megablock energy storage systems, which promise to reduce installation times and costs. The rally was also supported by broader market strength, as Wall Street indexes reached record highs amid expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 2.5% on the news that the company unveiled a new proposed compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion.
The long-term performance award, which shareholders will vote on in November, is designed to keep Musk at the helm for the next decade. The plan ties his compensation to a series of ambitious goals, including increasing Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion. To receive the full payout, which would be granted in 12 tranches, the company must also hit operational targets like delivering 20 million vehicles, producing one million robotaxis, and manufacturing one million humanoid robots. The proposal would also increase Musk's voting power within the company. Analysts view the move positively, with Wedbush noting the package is a ""critical next step to keep Musk as CEO at least until 2030"" during a key growth period.
Tesla is up 3.2% since the beginning of the year, but at $391.53 per share, it is still trading 18.4% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,799.

Key Notes
- The ONDO price rally on September 12 comes with a sharp rise in trading and derivatives activity.
- The rally coincides with a boom in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), with Ondo’s TVL rising to $1.56B.
- Analysts eye a breakout past $1.08 that could open the door for a move toward $2.10.
ONDO ONDO $0.77 24h volatility: 3.3% Market cap: $2.43 B Vol. 24h: $157.67 M , the native cryptocurrency of Ondo Finance, has gained another 6% on Sept. 12, extending its weekly rally to more than 15%. The bullish sentiment comes amid rising tokenized RWA assets on the platform, along with strong on-chain metrics.
Ondo Finance Sees Uptick in RWA Tokenized Assets
Over the past week, RWA tokens have staged a strong rally, with market capitalization climbing from $67 billion to nearly $76 billion over the past week. According to data from RWZ.xyz, the total value of tokenized assets on-chain surpassed $29 billion for the first time.
Ondo Finance has been one of the key contributors to this sectoral momentum. Earlier this week, on Sept. 9, Ondo partnered with Trust Wallet to introduce tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds. This allows global users to trade equities such as Apple and Tesla directly on-chain through the decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch.
This year, in 2025, Ondo Finance has seen substantial growth with the total value locked on the protocol rising from $650 million in January to $1.56 billion as of Sept. 12, based on DefiLlama data.
ONDO Price Prepares for Another 100% Upside
Today’s ONDO price rally comes with a 100% surge in daily trading volume to $430 million. Derivatives activity around Ondo also surged. Data from CoinGlass shows open interest climbed 14% to $585.74 million, while ONDO futures trading volume spiked 67% to $1.38 billion. Amid the rising demand for the altcoin, 21Shares filed for spot ONDO ETF back in July.
The near-term outlook for ONDO price looks bullish at the moment. ONDO is holding above the $1.01 support level on the daily chart. Sustained demand at this floor could lift the token to a six-month high of $1.23. A breakout above that resistance may pave the way for further gains toward $1.40.
Market analysts also stage the possibility of a 100% upside here to $2.10. ONDO is approaching a potential breakout after 190 days of consolidation. Technical charts show a head-and-shoulders bottom forming on the higher time frame.
As shown in the image above, the token is testing neckline resistance as $1.08. Breaking past this could set the stage for another 100% upside to its December 2024 highs of $2.10.
Maxi Doge Raises Over $2 Million
Along with ONDO rally, memecoin presale project Maxi Doge has successfully raised more than $2 million in presale fundraise. Maxi Doge distinct from the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has quickly gained traction in the crypto presale market. The project promotes the idea that “there’s nothing a degenerate can’t do if they put their mind to it,” a message resonating with retail investors.

Since then, a select group of tech-focused megacaps -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) -- have become known as Wall Street's ""Magnificent Seven."" Collectively, this cohort of tech titans has delivered impressive returns throughout the AI revolution.
Yet one of them stands out as a relative laggard. Over the last three years, Tesla shares are up just 18% -- a gain that trails all of its peers. Despite that underperformance, CEO Elon Musk has once again found a way to keep Tesla at the center of the AI conversation. According to a new proxy filing, the electric vehicle (EV) company is proposing a strategic investment in Musk's artificial intelligence start-up, xAI.
Tesla has made limited progress on the AI front compared to its peers, but aligning more directly with xAI could change that narrative. As the proposal moves toward a shareholder vote in November, understanding the mechanics of the deal and its implications for Tesla's future role in the AI realm will be critical for investors.
Why does Tesla want to invest in xAI?
For years, Musk has talked about turning Tesla from just an EV manufacturer into a broader technology powerhouse spanning autonomous driving, robotics, and clean energy systems. An investment in xAI would fit neatly into that playbook, giving Tesla direct access to Grok -- a large language model (LLM) designed to compete with ChatGPT.
The premise is straightforward: By embedding xAI's intelligence into its ecosystem, Tesla could make its products ""smarter"" and more intuitive.
Take the company's autonomous vehicle fleet as an example. An integration with xAI could improve training models for Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software as it pertains to natural language skills and real-time contextual awareness -- making its robotaxis not just safer, but also easier and more seamless to interact with.
This same logic extends to Optimus, Tesla's planned humanoid robot. Building mechanical dexterity is just one part of the equation. In order for Optimus robots to be truly useful, they will need to learn how to understand people, anticipate needs, and engage in natural conversations.
This is where xAI can lend a hand. Grok could become the foundational layer of social intelligence for Optimus, ultimately turning these robots into tools that can add to the efficiency of operations in settings like factories, retail, or even homes.
Musk wants to build an AI empire
xAI has received funding from several high-profile venture capital (VC) firms, but one of its more intriguing backers sits outside of Silicon Valley: Musk's space exploration business, SpaceX.
This cross-pollination appears very much by design. Musk's strategy is starting to become clear -- build a vertically integrated ecosystem where the hardware from Tesla and SpaceX is powered by xAI's software. By leveraging the intellectual property across these businesses, Musk aims to create a virtuous cycle that stretches across transportation, space, and robotics. As each piece reinforces the others, they could potentially unlock trillions of dollars of value in multiple emerging, sophisticated markets.
The bigger idea is to establish an AI moat that insulates Musk's businesses from dependence on other providers like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic. Tightening the business's integration should help keep costs under control -- all while powering Musk's companies on a shared AI backbone.
Is a Tesla investment in xAI a game changer?
The question of whether an equity stake in xAI could truly be a game changer for Tesla is more nuanced than it first appears.
On one hand, a closer alliance with xAI could accelerate its progress on initiatives like the Cybercab and Optimus -- potentially sharpening Tesla's competitive edge. On the other hand, the move could raise regulatory concerns around conflicts of interest -- ultimately becoming yet another distraction at a company that has been plagued with them in recent years.
At this stage, the deal feels more symbolic than transformational. The real impact will depend on how well xAI scales and performs relative to the competition. Until there's more clarity on how that's playing out, it's hard to see why a Tesla-xAI partnership would be a catalyst for the company. While this tie-up has long-term potential, it's not the kind of move that will redefine the AI landscape overnight."

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.9%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.66 points to a change of -31.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.48 indicates a change of +49.7% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Tesla."

finnhub,TSLA,2025-09-12T08:23:00,Why Elon Musk's Trillion-Dollar Tesla Pay Package Isn't as Crazy as It Sounds,The plan could actually yield the best possible outcome for shareholders.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1fc59c21316b855f725e23a6a36ab55d5fb0f91ddd36e1e49a9e79660c198655,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-elon-musks-trillion-dollar-tesla-pay-package-i/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-elon-musks-trillion-dollar-tesla-pay-package-i/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-elon-musks-trillion-dollar-tesla-pay-package-i/,fool.com,200,,"What can you give to the man who has everything?
The board of Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) recently answered this question when it revealed its proposed compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which could be worth more than $1 trillion.
At first glance, that sounds crazy. However, if you look at the details, it may not be so crazy after all.
Tesla needs Elon...
Tesla currently trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 200 -- unlike more traditional car companies like Toyota (TM 1.32%) and General Motors (GM 1.26%), which both trade at P/E ratios of about 9. That's largely because of Musk's high-tech vision for the company, which includes developing fully self-driving robotaxis and autonomous humanoid robots. That's a powerful incentive for Tesla's board to keep Musk at the helm.
But is it really worth $1 trillion?
Well, although the ""trillion-dollar"" aspect of the pay package has been highlighted, it's not like Tesla's board is just planning to hand Musk $1 trillion in cash. Instead, the compensation -- which consists largely of additional Tesla stock awards -- is broken up into 12 ""tranches,"" with each tranche tied to a particular performance-based milestone. If Musk doesn't meet that milestone within 10 years, he doesn't get that tranche of shares.
One milestone requires Musk to revitalize Tesla's struggling auto sales, reaching 20 million total cumulative vehicle sales within 10 years (the company has currently sold about 8 million over its lifetime). Others require him to successfully develop new products, including full self-driving EVs, robotaxis, and autonomous humanoid robots.
The remaining metrics include adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) minimums, which are tied to the company's earnings and not its share price, and increasing Tesla's market capitalization to $8.6 trillion, roughly an eightfold increase from its current $1.1 trillion valuation. Those are tall orders.
...more than Elon needs Tesla
Lately, Musk seems to have lost interest in electric vehicles. That's hardly surprising: He's always been a futurist, and now that EVs are everywhere -- practically every major automaker currently produces at least one -- he's more excited by the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.
But he doesn't necessarily need to pursue those technologies through Tesla.
Musk already owns an AI company (xAI), where he could easily pursue future autonomous technologies. He could also develop them through a brand-new company: He could call it ""Musk's Marvelous Mannequins!"" Given his past successes, personal wealth, and current high profile, he'd likely have no trouble raising capital.
True, Tesla has already done a lot of work on autonomous self-driving and its Optimus line of humanoid robots, but Musk exercises significant control over Tesla's board, so it would probably be pretty easy for him to engineer a spinoff or sale of those business lines to a different company he controls.
What Tesla can offer
One thing Musk can't bestow on himself is the title ""World's First Trillionaire.""
Departing Tesla and trying to pursue automation, AI, and robotics through xAI or a new company would involve a lot of costs and complications. Meanwhile, Tesla's stock would almost certainly take a hit, and although Musk's 13% stake in Tesla only makes up about one-third of his current $435 billion net worth, nobody likes to lose tens of billions of dollars (though, to be fair, most of us will never have that opportunity).
While I can't speak for Musk, I know that if someone offered me a job that could result in my becoming the world's first trillionaire, I'd be unlikely to turn it down, even if I wasn't particularly excited about some of the job duties, and even if some of the milestones would be difficult to achieve. For Musk, it's probably a worthwhile trade-off.
From a Tesla investor's perspective, if Elon Musk can develop working self-driving cars, robotaxis, and autonomous humanoid robots within 10 years, plus grow Tesla's market cap eightfold, he probably deserves the payout he'd get. This makes this pay package -- eye-popping though it is -- a win-win for Tesla shareholders."
