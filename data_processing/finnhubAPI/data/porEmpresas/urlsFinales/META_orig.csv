It appears in one eye it's slightly off center, so it doesn't block your view and it disappears after a few seconds when it's not in use so it doesn't distract you.”Huawei has outlined its long-term chip plans for the first time .It's said it will launch some of the world's most powerful computing systems - underscoring China's drive to wean itself off foreign semiconductor suppliers like Nvidia.In an announcement that broke years of secrecy about its chips business, Huawei detailed timelines for its Ascend artificial intelligence chips and Kunpeng server chips.Two Chinese companies — WeRide and Pony.ai — say they will partner with local firms to launch robotaxi services in Singapore.The city-state is expanding into autonomous driving.Ride-hailing operator Grab said it would also partner with WeRide to begin services next year.Brazil's Embraer could get certification of its electric aircraft in 2027.Although the new president of the country's aviation regulator told Reuters he would like to hit that milestone a year earlier.Embraer's subsidiary Eve is among several firms developing battery-powered aircraft that can take off and land vertically to ferry travellers on short city trips.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=57371cdc6a0c03dbd6f2aa67d401c2cdf90da5d1c27500b12fb99c0d13120976,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-weekly-ai-tie-ups-143334869.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-weekly-ai-tie-ups-143334869.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-weekly-ai-tie-ups-143334869.html,yahoo.com,200,

It appears in one eye it's slightly off center, so it doesn't block your view and it disappears after a few seconds when it's not in use so it doesn't distract you.”But Zuckerberg is planning for a day when smart glasses can do much more.He says they are the perfect device for interacting with so-called “superintelligence” - that’s AI that exceeds human capability:""Glasses are the ideal form factor for personal superintelligence, because they let you stay present in the moment while getting access to all of these AI capabilities that make you smarter, help you communicate better, improve your memory, improve your senses, and more.”Meta has enjoyed some commercial success with earlier versions of its smart glasses, which also got updates Wednesday.But it’s widely seen as trailing rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet in developing AI systems.The company has been recruiting aggressively in a bid to close that gap.One analyst told Reuters that Meta still had work to do in convincing people that smart glasses are a gadget they need.But he said there was scope for it to grab a big share of the market for such devices.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5fc6771dc31520515165ae3d34736684471e37f62cfb70f5625dd8594ae12d7f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/meta-launches-smart-glasses-gets-100747462.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/meta-launches-smart-glasses-gets-100747462.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/meta-launches-smart-glasses-gets-100747462.html,yahoo.com,200,
